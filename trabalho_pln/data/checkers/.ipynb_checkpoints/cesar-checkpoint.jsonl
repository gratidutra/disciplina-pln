India\n\n## Abstract\n\nDeducing the molecular details of membrane protein folding has lately become an important area of research in biology. Using Ail, an outer membrane protein (OMP) from Yersina pestis as our model, we explore details of β -barrel folding, stability, and unfolding. Ail displays a simple transmembrane β -barrel topology. Here, we find that Ail follows a simple two-state mechanism in its folding and unfolding thermodynamics. Interestingly, Ail displays multi-step folding kinetics. The early kinetic intermediates in the folding pathway populate near the unfolded state ( β T ≈ 0.20), and do not display detectable changes in the local environment of the two interface indoles. Interestingly, tryptophans regulate the late events of barrel rearrangement, and Ail thermodynamic stability. We show that W 149 → Y\/F\/A substitution destabilizes Ail by ~0.13-1.7 kcal mol -1 , but retains path-independent thermodynamic equilibrium of Ail. In surprising contrast, substituting W 42  and retaining W 149  shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium to an apparent kinetic retardation of only the unfolding process, which gives rise to an associated increase in scaffold stability by ~0.31.1 kcal mol -1 . This is accompanied by the formation of an unusual hyperfluorescent state in the unfolding pathway that is more structured, and represents a conformationally dynamic unfolding intermediate with the interface W 149  now lipid solvated. The defined role of each tryptophan and poorer folding efficiency of Trp mutants together presents compelling evidence for the importance of interface aromatics in the unique (un)folding pathway of Ail, and offers interesting insight on alternative pathways in generalized OMP assembly and unfolding mechanisms.\n\n## Keywords\n\nYersinia Ail; Aromatic girdle; Unfolding intermediate; Hyperfluorescence; Lipid-protein interaction\n\n* Coressponding author at: Molecular Biophysics Laboratory, Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Room #324, III Floor, Block C, Academic Bldg. 3, Bhauri, Bhopal 462066.

The folding microenvironment and key residues in the primary sequence play vital roles in the folding process of both transmembrane α -helices and β -barrels. Despite several efforts, we still lack a complete understanding of how transmembrane β -barrels assemble. The energy landscape of β -barrel folding is dictated by the primary sequence of protein (intramolecular interactions in the polypeptide), and the surrounding lipidic milieu [1]. Under physiological conditions, outer membrane β -barrel proteins (OMPs) of Gram-negative bacteria assemble through folding intermediates, and this process is assisted by the barrel assembly machinery [3,6,7]. However, OMPs retain the ability to fold independently in vitro. This property of OMPs facilitates the biophysical analysis of folding intermediates in barrel assembly, and the influence of the protein sequence on the folding pathway [7-9]. For example, the outer membrane β -barrel proteins (OMPs) OmpA and OmpX from Escherichia coli sample several short-lived partially folded conformations during folding, and achieve complete folding by a multi-step concerted mechanism [9-11]. These transient intermediates direct the nascent polypeptide to its folded state within biologically relevant timescales, while avoiding misfolding and aggregation [8,11]. The characterization of such intermediates is crucial to understand the folding energy landscape. However, the partially folded conformations are transient and do not accumulate under equilibrium conditions [9,11]. A two-state folding mechanism is therefore sufficient to explain, and is consistent with the thermodynamic equilibrium observed during OMP folding [8,11-13]. Primarily, the rate-limiting step is studied, where the unfolded and native states are separated by a large energy barrier.\n\nThe folding of OMPs requires a particularly intricate interplay of thermodynamic and kinetic elements that together define the conversion of the unfolded polypeptide into a biologically active and stable β -barrel conformation. While OMPs do exhibit thermodynamic equilibrium in vitro, it has been proposed that OMPs in the bacterial outer membrane are kinetically stabilized, as they possess high activation energy barrier for unfolding, and show slow equilibration in thermodynamic measurements [4,10,14,15]. It is believed that this kinetic stability is essential for OMPs to function in a constantly changing external environment. Owing to this kinetic stability, in vitro (un)folding measurements of several OMPs are characterized by accumulation of trapped intermediates in the folding or unfolding pathway, leading to hysteresis [7,8,16]. The characterization of such intermediates can provide useful information on the microscopic structure of the transition state, and the macroscopic mechanism of OMP assembly. Our current knowledge of OMP assembly has been obtained from extensive studies of E. coli proteins. Interestingly, however, recent studies show that membrane proteins exhibit species-specific variations in their folding mechanism [17-19]. It is therefore important to assess the assembly of atypical OMPs of other bacteria.\n\nThe formation of stable or transient (un)folding intermediates in OMPs is strongly regulated by specific residues in the polypeptide. For example, conserved aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr, Trp) located at the solvent-membrane interface act as lipid anchors during OMP assembly. Indeed, previous studies on various E. coli OMPs including OmpA [20], OmpX\n\n[21], PagP [13], OmpLA [22], FomA [23], and the human mitochondrial VDAC [24] highlight the importance of interface aromatics, particularly tryptophan, for β -barrel folding. Recent studies of these OMPs in lipidic vesicles have revealed interesting insights on unassisted OMP folding [12]. However, a detailed study of folding intermediates in vesicles is compounded by the accumulation of a heterogeneous population of partly folded states. In interesting contrast, detergent micelles conveniently alleviate this problem by stabilizing fewer long-lived intermediates while also retaining path-independent folding [14,16]. For example, phosphocholine (PC) micelles, which possess a similar zwitterionic nature as diacyl PC lipids, promote β -barrel folding without aggregation, are suitable for structural studies, and facilitate the mapping membrane protein folding intermediates [1,9].\n\nIn this study, we investigate the thermodynamic and kinetic factors contributing to the folding and stability of an atypical OMP from the category A pathogen Yersinia pestis. The attachment invasion locus (Ail) protein is an 8-stranded OMP vital for Y. pestis serum resistance, adhesion to and internalization into host cells, Yersinia outer proteins (Yop) delivery, and inhibition of host inflammatory response [25,26]. The study of Ail is therefore of interest as a potent drug target against this category A bioterrorism agent. Ail possess two interface tryptophans, W 42  and W 149  (of a total ~17% aromatic residues (2 Trp, 12 Tyr, and 12 Phe) in its polypeptide sequence of 157 amino acids) (Fig. 1A), which are important for Ail folding in detergent micelles [25]. Using fluorescence analysis of single tryptophan mutants, we show that Ail exhibits complex (un)folding kinetics, with a rapid assembly phase followed by slow rearrangement kinetics in PC micelles. A similar complex folding pathway is known so far only for E. coli OmpA [16]. An unexpected observation in our study is the disruption of Ail thermodynamic equilibrium upon mutation of W 42 . The AilPC system now shifts to kinetic control, leading to an apparent hysteresis. This hysteresis is accompanied by the formation of a hyperfluorescent intermediate that represents a lipid-solvated partially unfolded barrel. We find that the anchoring and stabilizing roles of W 42  and W 149  together play distinct roles in deciding the folding landscape of Ail, thereby offering interesting insight on novel intermediates in the OMP folding and unfolding pathways. Our findings with Ail will also serve as an excellent starting point to study the complex assembly and unfolding pathways of OMPs from other pathogens.\n\n## 2 Materials and methods\n\n## 2.1 Protein preparation and folding\n\nAll the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC., and DPC (n-dodecyl phosphocholine) from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster. The ail gene (without signal sequence) was cloned into a pET3a vector, and all the single Trp mutants W 42 → F\/Y\/A and W 149 → F\/Y\/A were generated using site directed mutagenesis. All the proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli C41 cells, and purified using reported protocols [25,26]. Independent protein preparations were used to set up each replicate experiment.\n\nFolding efficiency of Ail was screened in increasing concentrations of DPC (5 mM - 50 mM) from the unfolded Ail stock prepared in 8.0 m GdnHCl (guanidine hydrochloride) (data not shown). Above 10 mM DPC, complete folding of Ail was obtained without any detectable aggregation; thus, we selected 20 mM DPC concentration for further experiments.\n\nThe micelle integrity in 6.4 m GdnHCl (highest concentration used in our experiments) was checked independently using SYPRO® orange (discussed later in Fig. S2), as described previously [25].\n\nFolding of Ail was achieved by rapid 10-fold dilution of the unfolded protein (~1400 µM Ail in 8.0 m GdnHCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5), into the folding reaction containing 100 mM DPC prepared in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, followed by incubation for 5 h at 25 °C. Trace amounts of aggregated protein (if any) was removed by high-speed centrifugation at 18,000 xg at 10 °C. This folded 5× stock was diluted 5-fold in all the experiments, to achieve a final protein and DPC concentration of 28 µM and 20 mM, respectively (detergent-to-protein ratio of ~700:1) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 containing 160 mM GdnHCl. Protein concentration was quantified using A  280 , with different extinction coefficients for the WT and Trp mutants (28,880 M -1  cm -1  for Ail WT; 23,380 M -1  cm -1  for W42F, W149F, W42A, and W149A; 24,870 M -1  cm -1  for W42Y and W149Y at 280 nm).\n\n## 2.2 Assessment of folded Ail using mobility shift, far-UV CD, and NMR spectroscopy\n\nUpon folding, Ail exhibits different electrophoretic mobility compared to the unfolded protein, on cold SDS-PAGE gels. All the folded protein samples and samples before and after each experiment were checked for sample integrity and folding efficiency on 15% SDS-PAGE gels using the electrophoretic mobility assay [25].\n\nThe secondary structure content of WT Ail and all the folded Trp variants was checked using far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism (CD). All the CD measurements were carried out on a J-815 CD spectropolarimeter (JASCO Inc.) equipped with a water-cooled peltier 6-cell system, at 25 °C. For all the CD measurements, we used 28 µM folded protein in 20 mM DPC and 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, as described above. We recorded the far-UV CD spectra for Ail-WT and all the Trp mutants from 205 to 260 nm at a constant scan speed of 100 nm\/min, data integration time of 1 s, and data pitch of 0.5 nm. The data were averaged over three accumulations, and corrected for contributions from buffer and DPC micelles. The raw ellipticity value at 215 nm was then converted to molar ellipticity (ME  215 ). All the samples were checked on cold SDS-PAGE gels before and after the experiment.\n\nThe folded 5× stocks of uniformly  15 N-labeled WT, W42F, and W149F were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris buffer using stepwise dialysis to remove trace amounts of GdnHCl, as described previously [25]. HSQC-TROSY experiments were recorded at 45 °C on a 700 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe, as we were not able to observe well-dispersed HSQC-TROSY spectra of Ail at 25 °C due to sample viscosity (discussed in the results section). The final protein concentration of ~140 µM Ail in 100 mM DPC, corresponding to a DPR of ~700:1 was used for NMR measurements. The NMR samples were checked on 15% SDS-PAGE before recording HSQC-TROSY experiments. The data were processed and plotted using reported methods [27].\n\n## 2.3 (Un)folding kinetics measurements and chevron analysis\n\nThe (un)folding kinetics measurements were carried out using the RX2000 rapid mixing accessory (Applied Photophysics Ltd.) that was coupled to a FluoroMax 4 fluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon Ltd.), with a dead time of ~8 ms. The kinetics measurements were\n\ncarried out at 25 °C by monitoring changes in Trp fluorescence, using λ ex = 295 nm and λ em-max  = 340 nm. For folding kinetics, the 5× unfolded protein stock (140 µM unfolded Ail in 5.0 m GdnHCl, and 20 mM Tris pH 8.5), was diluted 5-fold in 25 mM DPC containing varying concentrations of GdnHCl. Similarly, unfolding kinetics was measured by rapid dilution of the 5× folded protein stock (140 µM folded Ail in 100 mM DPC and 800 mM GdnHCl, in 20 mM Tris pH 8.5) into varying concentration of GdnHCl, and change in the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm was monitored. The DPR of ~700:1 was maintained throughout the kinetics measurements. The change in Trp fluorescence was monitored till the reaction attained saturation and no further change in fluorescence intensity was observed. The kinetic traces were recorded for &gt; 40 GdnHCl concentrations. All the kinetic measurements were carried out three times from the same stock sample. Each trace was fitted individually and the mean data obtained at each [GdnHCl] was used for the chevron analysis. In addition, at least 30 data points (~14 from folding kinetics and ~17 from unfolding kinetics measurements) were used for the chevron analysis of each protein to obtained reliable data.\n\nThe initial folding of Ail was completed within the dead time of the experiment. We fitted the slow rates of folding and unfolding for the final analyses (the fast rates were not measured due to experimental limitations). The data obtained from (un)folding measurements were processed as described previously [24]. Briefly, the kinetic traces were fitted to a single exponential function, and the rates k  (folding rate) and k f u (unfolding rate) were obtained at various GdnHCl concentrations. Here, the initial ~50-100 s of the folding kinetic traces, and ~10-20 s of the unfolding kinetics traces were not used in the fitting (discussed later in Fig. S6). The chevron plots thus obtained from these rates were then fitted globally to a two-state equation [12] with a shared m  f  and m  u (constants that represent the change in the accessible surface for a protein on folding or unfolding, respectively), to derive \/u1D458 f 0 and \/u1D458 u 0 (folding and unfolding rates, respectively, in buffer), and the kinetic free energy Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 was calculated for all the proteins. A shared m value was used, as the mutation of a single residue does not affect the overall change in accessible surface area of the protein (supported by the far-UV CD profiles). We obtain the standard deviation for Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 from propagation of uncertainty (propagation of error) obtained from \/u1D458 f 0 and \/u1D458 u 0 , as mentioned below [28]:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nhere, \/u1D6FF Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 = error for Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 ; \/u1D6FF\/u1D458 f 0 = error for r\/u1D458 f 0 ; and \/u1D6FF\/u1D458 u 0 = error for \/u1D458 u 0 .\n\n## 3 Equilibrium (un)folding titrations\n\nThe equilibrium (un)folding experiments were carried out as described earlier with minor modifications [25]. The unfolded protein stock (140 µM Ail in 100 mM DPC and 5.0 m GdnHCl, in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5) and the folded protein stock (140 µM Ail in 100 mM DPC and 800 mM GdnHCl, in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5) were diluted 5-fold into a\n\nGdnHCl gradient, and a DPR of 700:1 was maintained throughout the experiments. The lowest GdnHCl concentration that can be achieved in the folding equilibrium is 1.0 M, while the lowest GdnHCl concentration for the unfolding equilibrium is 0.16 M. Therefore, the GdnHCl range for folding and unfolding titrations is from 1.0 M-5.0 m and 0.16 M-6.0 M, respectively. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C, and Trp fluorescence emission spectra were acquired between 320 and 380 nm, using a λ ex = 295 nm. Equilibrium was achieved within 24 h, and the 48 h data was used for analysis. For all the equilibrium measurements, 33 data points (for both folding and unfolding equilibrium) were acquired from at least 3 independent datasets obtained from independent folding and unfolding stocks prepared from at least 3 independent purified protein preparations. The fraction unfolded (f U  ) at λ em-max of 336 nm and the average wavelength (&lt; λ &gt;) values were plotted against the respective GdnHCl concentrations, as described previously [25]. The average wavelength data for folding and unfolding equilibrium of all the proteins were fitted globally to a two-state unfolding model with a shared m, as described previously [12]. We obtain a common m of -3.21 kcal mol -1  M -1  for all the proteins, except for the folding equilibrium data of W42X mutants, where the m value is different (-2.52 kcal mol -1  M -1 ). The calculated m values were used to derive the midpoint of the chemical denaturation (C  m ), and absolute or apparent folding and unfolding free energy values (∆G  0,F  or Δ \/u1D43A app 0, F , and ∆G  0,U or Δ \/u1D43A app 0, U , respectively). Anisotropy (r) values of all postequilibrium (48 h) samples were recorded at 25 °C, as described previously [25]. The anisotropy values obtained for each sample was plotted against the respective GdnHCl concentrations, and the data were fitted to a sigmoidal function to derive the C  m . C m-start is the intercept of the linear extrapolations of the pre-transition baseline and transition zone in the equilibrium profiles (see [29] for similar calculations from thermal measurements).\n\n## 4 Acrylamide quenching and lifetime measurements\n\nWe studied the local environment of both tryptophans using its intrinsic fluorescence as the reporter. Post-equilibrium samples (48 h) were incubated with increasing concentrations of acrylamide (0.0-0.5 M) for 15 min, and Trp fluorescence ( λ ex = 295 nm and λ em-max = 336 nm) was recorded. The λ em-max  for the sample without acrylamide was used for normalization, and the data obtained were fitted to a polynomial function. The slope of the polynomial fit corresponded to the Stern-Volmer quenching constant (K  SV ) [25]. Average Trp lifetime (&lt; τ &gt;) was measured for all the samples on a DeltaFlex TCSPC system (Horiba Jobin Yvon Ltd.), as described earlier [25]. Briefly, samples with and without acrylamide were excited at 292 nm, and Trp lifetime was recorded at the λ em-max  for all the samples (336 nm for the folded, 340 nm for partially unfolded, 354 nm for partially folded and unfolded samples). Decay curves were fitted to a three exponential decay function to derive the &lt; τ &gt;. The χ 2  values were maintained at &lt; 1.2. The bimolecular quenching rate constant (k q ) and apparent rotational correlation time ( τ c ) were derived using the formulae k  q  = K SV\/&lt; τ &gt; and τ c =&lt; τ &gt; r\/(r 0 -r) [5]. Here, r 0  = 0.3, and represents the anisotropy of free indole [5]. In all measurements, samples folded in DPC (containing 0.16 m GdnHCl), and protein in 8.0 m GdnHCl without DPC, served as the folded and unfolded controls, respectively.\n\n## 4.1 Co-evolutionary analysis of W 42  and W 149\n\nCo-evolution analysis of the two intrinsic Trp residues of Ail was done using EVfold (http:\/\/ evfold.org\/) [30]. Here, we first generated the multiple sequence alignment of various OMPs using Pfam (pfam.sanger.ac.uk) database. The EVfold server (http:\/\/evfold.org\/) [30] was then used to perform the co-evolution analysis to find the conservation pattern for W 42  and W 149 . For the EVFold analysis, Ail sequences from Y. pestis, and the crystal structure of Ail (PDB ID: 3QRA) was used as template. Coevolving residues are presented as a network, for comparison.\n\n## 5 Results\n\n## 5.1 Folding analysis of Ail and its mutants in zwitterionic DPC micelles\n\nAil possesses two tryptophans at positions 42 and 149. Here, W 149  is highly conserved across most OMPs, whereas W 42  is less conserved (while Trp is more abundant, Leu and Phe are also observed) (Fig. S1). Both Trp residues of Ail are located at the membranewater interface (Fig. 1A). To address the role of Trp in particular and aromaticity in general on Ail folding, we systematically substituted each Trp to Phe, Tyr, or Ala (Fig. 1B). In the first set of experiments, we folded Ail and its interface Trp mutants in the zwitterionic 12-C detergent n-dodecyl phosphocholine (DPC) micelles. The detergent-to-protein ratio (DPR) is critical for Ail folding and stability [25]. Ail remains largely monomeric and well-folded in DPC concentrations &gt; 10 mM (data not shown). On the basis of the screening results, we selected 28 µM Ail and 20 mM DPC (DPR of ~700:1), in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, and a temperature of 25 °C, for our experiments. As urea does not fully unfold Ail [25], for our thermodynamic measurements, we used guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) as the denaturant. To ensure that Ail unfolding was not due to the dissociation of DPC micelles, we checked for micelle integrity in the presence of up to 6.4 m GdnHCl, using the fluorescence of SYPRO ®  orange dye (CMC of DPC in buffer is ~1.25 mM, whereas the CMC increases to ~12.5 mM in 6.4 m GdnHCl) (Fig. S2). Therefore, we carried out all our studies in 20 mM DPC, which is at least 2-fold higher than the CMC of DPC in the highest [GdnHCl] used in this study. This ensured that the energetics we measure here stems primarily from the biophysical properties of the protein.\n\nIn DPC micelles, folded Ail has markedly different biophysical properties from the unfolded protein. For example, in cold SDS-PAGE gels, Ail exhibits a prominent electrophoretic migration upon folding (Fig. S3). Folded Ail is resistant to proteolysis (data not shown). The secondary structure content of Ail assessed using far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry shows prominent negative ellipticity centered at 215 nm, characteristic of a β -sheet rich structure (Fig. 1C). A similar β -sheet content seen for all the Trp mutants confirms that the mutation does not affect the overall scaffold of Ail. A blue-shifted fluorescence emission spectrum with maximum emission intensity ( λ em-max ) at 336 nm is also seen for Ail WT and the mutants upon folding in DPC micelles (see Fig. S4). HSQC-TROSY spectra of uniformly  15 N-la-beled Ail show well-dispersed resonances that superpose well for Ail WT and its Trp mutants (Fig. 2). Overall, these results confirm that under in vitro folding conditions, all the mutants fold to a similar extent, and Trp substitution does not impede the ability of Ail to form a well-folded barrel.\n\nInterestingly, the single Trp mutants (W42X and W149X) show distinctly different fluorescence intensities at 336 nm (Fig. 1D). This change in the spectral property suggests that W 42  and W 149  reside in different local environments. The latter is further evident in HSQC-TROSY measurements of Ail WT and its mutants (Fig. 2). Here, a more downfield shifted W 42  amide resonance indicates that this indole resides in a more polar environment than W 149 . Our conclusion is also confirmed by anisotropy (r) measurements, with r ≈ 0.155 ± 0.004 for W 42  (W149X mutants) and r ≈ 0.126 ± 0.008 for W 149  (W42X mutants) (see Table S1 for a comparison of r values), showing a difference of ~0.029. Differences in anisotropy between two distinct states of a membrane protein are small (Table S1), and such differences are indeed significant. The results from fluorescence, NMR, and anisotropy together reveal that W 42  resides in a more polar and rigid environment, whereas W 149 is present in a comparatively more apolar and dynamic environment. Next, we carried out kinetics and equilibrium measurements in DPC micelles using Trp as the reporter to understand the biophysical characteristics that influence folding-unfolding pathways of Ail.\n\n## 5.2 Ail core assembles independent of interface residues\n\nTo understand the early events in Ail (un)folding, we used the two interface tryptophans as reporters of β -barrel assembly. The two Trp residues in Ail are located at opposite faces of the barrel, and reside in dissimilar local environments, as discussed above. This provides a unique advantage to monitor distinct changes in Ail during barrel folding. We measured the conformational changes of DPC-folded Ail, spectroscopically using increasing concentrations of GdnHCl as the denaturant. Representative folding and unfolding kinetics of Ail WT are presented in Fig. 3A (see Fig. S5 for the magnified traces). The process is accompanied by a rapid change in the fluorescence intensity in both the folding and unfolding kinetics that occurs within the dead time of detection. Ail folding is, therefore, faster than other bacterial OMPs such as PagP [12], OmpX [21], and OmpA [16]. This 'burst phase' intensity varies proportionately with increase in the denaturant concentration, and indicates the accumulation of an early intermediate in the (un) folding of Ail (see Fig. S5 for magnified traces highlighting the initial burst phase and lag phase). Although we could not capture this early intermediate, the kinetic traces are comparable for the mutants, allowing us to conclude that the early events in Ail (un)folding are Trp-independent and do not involve detectable changes in the local environment of both the indoles.\n\nAil (un)folding kinetics shows the presence of at least two phases, where the rapid (un)folding event (in seconds) is followed by slow (un) folding transition that occurs over minutes (Fig. 3A). Here, the folding kinetics traces show three transitions: an early decay phase, followed by a fast folding phase and a slow folding phase (Fig. S6A). We fi tted all the transitions individually to single exponential functions to derive folding rates (k d1 , k  f1 , and k f2 ) (Fig. S6A). Interestingly, only the amplitude A  f2  associated with the rate k  f2 shows a significant dependence on the GdnHCl concentration, indicating that only k f2 contributes significantly to the folding process that we are monitoring. Therefore, we used only the slowest rate for our analysis (Fig. S6A). Similarly, the unfolding kinetics traces can be fitted to both single as well as double exponential functions. As seen with the folding kinetics, the slow rate of unfolding (k  u ) and the associated amplitude (A  u ) obtained from a single exponential function was sufficient to explain the unfolding profiles (Fig. S6B).\n\nOverall, Ail shows complex folding and unfolding profiles comprising of multiple transitions (Fig. S6C). Such complex folding kinetics is well-known for transmembrane β -barrels in membranes [10,14], but is rare in micelles and has been reported so far only for E. coli OmpA [16]. As the folding and unfolding amplitudes for the fast rates (A  d1 and A  u1 ) show no denaturant dependence (see Fig. S6), we analyzed only the slow rates of (un)folding (see Fig. S6 for details). Chevron plots generated from the slow rates (k  f2  and k u ) show linear folding and unfolding arms with no rollover for Ail WT and all the mutants (Fig. 3B, S6C). The data were fitted to a two-state model to derive the folding and unfolding rate constants, change in accessible surface area, and the stability. Comparison of the change in free energy ( Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 ) reveals that the (un)folding kinetics of Ail is not significantly affected by mutating the interface Trp residues. For example, Ail WT shows a Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 of ~7.9 kcal mol -1 , which is similar across the Trp mutants. A marginal destabilization of ~0.5 kcal mol -1  is seen only for W149F (Fig. 3C, Table S2). Overall, we observe that Trp substitution does not significantly affect the Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 of Ail.\n\nNext, we calculated the Tanford β ( β T) value, which is a measure of the compactness of the transition state. In other words, β T measures the average degree of exposure of the protein in the transition state compared to the native or unfolded states [31]. High β T values (up to ~0.95), indicates that the protein shows native-like compaction in the transition state. We obtain similar β T values of ~0.20 for all the mutants (Table S2), which suggests that in the transition state, the environment of both tryptophans resembles the unfolded state. The values obtained for Ail are higher than bacteriorhodopsin ( β T = 0.13-0.14) [32], but marginally lower than the rhomboid protease GlpG ( β T = 0.23 ± 0.02) [33]. β T values for bacteriorhodopsin and GlpG (unfolded using SDS) are underestimated, because the denatured state of helical proteins in SDS is more compact due to incomplete unfolding. On the other hand, the β T of Ail is lower than other transmembrane β -barrel proteins; e.g., β T is ~0.48 for human mitochondrial VDAC2 porin in GdnHCl [24], ~0.23 and ~0.29 for OmpA in urea and GdnHCl, respectively (here, β T was calculated only using m  f  and m  u ) [16]. Hence, the transition state structure of Ail is less compact than other β -barrels.\n\nOverall, we find that Ail folding in DPC micelles occurs through the formation of an early intermediate that subsequently undergoes slow rearrangement over several seconds-minutes to form the folded barrel. Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 and β T values together support our conclusion that neither interface tryptophan contributes significantly to the early intermediates formed in the folding and unfolding processes. In other words, mutations of the two interface indoles bear little impact on Ail (un)folding kinetics. A similar folding mechanism is also observed in E. coli OmpA in vesicles [16], suggesting that the process of OMP folding in micelles and vesicles could indeed be similar. Further investigation of the transition state is presently underway to obtain a better understanding of Ail assembly.\n\n## 5.3 Substitution of W 42  shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium towards kinetic control\n\nAil exhibits path-independent reversible folding and attains thermodynamic equilibrium in DPC micelles in ~24 h (Fig. 4A, middle panel; and S8). Here, the folded protein shows a λ em-max ≈ 336 nm, which shows a red shift to λ em-max ≈ 360 nm upon barrel unfolding in\n\nhigh GdnHCl concentrations (Fig. S9). We fitted the data to a two-state model with a shared m of ± 3.21 kcal mol -1  M -1  to obtain the thermodynamic parameters listed in Table 1 (also see Fig. 4, Table S3). The W42X mutants showed poorer folding cooperativity and an m = -2.52 kcal mol  -1  m  -1 was used. The WT protein shows no hysteresis and we obtain a change in the equilibrium free energy derived from the unfolding transition (∆G 0, U ) of ~8.0 kcal mol -1 , which is similar to the Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 (see Fig. 3C).\n\nSimilar to WT, the W 149 → F\/Y\/A mutants also show no hysteresis. Interestingly, Trp substitution lowers the thermodynamic stability of Ail (Table 1). Mutating W 149  to the other aromatic residues destabilizes Ail marginally (Fig. 4, and S8; Table 1 and S3). The extent of destabilization is highest in the Ala mutant, where there is a considerable decrease in free energy by ~1.7 kcal mol -1 . Further, the lowered C  m  of W149A mutant suggests that at the 149th position, a preference is seen for aromatic side chains (Fig. 4B, Table 1 and S3), which is in line with the lipid-solvated environment for this indole. Our results show that W 149  helps in stabilizing the folded Ail barrel, and in resisting protein solvation by GdnHCl. Beyond a critical concentration of GdnHCl, native contacts are rapidly replaced by protein-GdnHCl interactions, and both Ail WT and W149X show cooperative unfolding (note the similar m eq value in Fig. 4, Table 1 and S3).\n\nIn interesting contrast to the W149X mutants, the substitution of W 42  (to F\/Y\/A) results in prominent hysteresis (Fig. 4A, left panel, and S8), and the stability of the mutant appears to now be under kinetic control. It must be noted here that in the W42X mutants, we monitor the fluorescence properties of W 149 . From the folding titration for the W 42 → F\/Y\/A mutants, we obtain Δ \/u1D43A app 0, F values that are lower than Ail WT by ~2.3-3.5 kcal mol -1 , with the W42A mutant showing the highest destabilization (see Table S3). As with the W149A mutant, the substitution of W 42  to Ala is more deleterious than Tyr and Phe. In all three W42X mutants, barrel formation is completed only when the GdnHCl concentration is lowered considerably and after prolonged incubation at 25 °C (for &gt; 5 h, see Methods for details; complete folding is demonstrated in Fig. 1C, 2, S3 and S4). Comparison of the Δ \/u1D43A app 0, F obtained from the folding titrations suggests that W 42  is more important than W 149  for Ail stability. The absence of hysteresis in Ail WT and W149X mutants suggests that substitution of W 42  gives rise to the observed hysteresis in the unfolding titrations, and that W 42  is required for path-independent (un)folding of Ail.\n\nUnlike the W149X mutants, all the folded W 42 → F\/Y\/A mutants resist GdnHCl-mediated unfolding, and exhibit a substantial increase in thermodynamic parameters (Table 1 and S3). For instance, the ∆G app, W42 → A  0, U is &gt; 1.0 kcal mol -1 higher than Ail WT (Fig. 4B, Table 1 and S3). To verify our observation, we monitored changes in fluorophore rigidity during barrel (un)folding by measuring Trp fluorescence anisotropy (r). In line with equilibrium measurements, the anisotropy (r) measurements also indicate that WT and W149X mutants show no hysteresis (Fig. S8 and S10). In contrast, the W42X mutants show hysteresis and a concomitant increase in the C  m  of unfolding (Fig. S8 and S10). The observed hysteresis is consistent in our &lt; λ &gt;, f U, and r measurements, which validates our inference that W 42 maintains the path-independent folding of Ail and keeps the barrel under thermodynamic equilibrium, and mutation of W 42  switches the unfolding pathway to kinetic control. Further,\n\nwe also observe poor(er) folding efficiency of the W42X mutants and an associated lowering of the folding free energy. Previously, we have also shown an important role of W 42  during Ail folding in LDAO micelles [25]. Putting together the rigid nature of W 42 , its position at the lipid interface, and the change in free energies (Tables S1, S2, and S3; Figs. 1, 3, and 4), we propose that W 42  contributes to Ail barrel rearrangement by the likely formation of optimal anchoring interactions with the lipidic milieu.\n\nTo obtain molecular insight on how the local Trp environment influences our observation, we carried out a co-evolution analysis to map the interaction network of each indole. W 42 shows the presence of three aromatic residues (F 28 , F 80 , Y 36 ) and several polar entities (E 37 , N 39 , D 40 , D 41 , R 81 ) in its 5 Å vicinity (Fig. S11). Abundance of polar residues in the vicinity of an aromatic residue such as W 42  suggests a lipidanchoring role for the Trp, Phe, and Tyr residues at the periplasmic face of the barrel. On the other hand, W 149  is surrounded largely by aromatic (Y 11 , Y 136 ) and hydrophobic residues (A 12 , M 150 , L 151 ); polar entities (S 14 , Q 147 , T 148 ) are less abundant than the vicinity of W 42 , and charged residues are absent (Fig. S11), indicating that W 149  is more lipid solvated than W 42 . Based on the structure of Ail, W 149  is likely to establish T-shaped aromatic interactions with Y 11  and Y 136 . Such Trp-Tyr interactions are energetically favorable, and can contribute up to 1.0 kcal mol -1 per interaction [20,27]. Interestingly, W 42  coevolves with the three hydrophobic and apolar residues P 78 , F 80 , and L 88 , whereas W 149  shows direct co-evolution with A 134 , S 135 , and Y 136  (Fig. S12 and Table S5). Both tryptophans form a strong evolutionary interaction network with both polar and apolar residues (Fig. S12 and Table S5), with W 149  being more conserved and forming a larger molecular interactome than W 42 . Hence, the evolutionary selection of W 42  in Ail is a direct consequence of the role of this indole in Ail assembly and scaffold stability.\n\nOverall, our results allow us to reach the following conclusions: (i) at the interface, the thermodynamic preference for residues 42 and 149 follows the order W &gt; Y ≈ F &gt; A; (ii) the mutation of W 42  lowers Ail folding efficiency; thereby, W 42  is more important than W 149  for Ail folding, (iii) W 42  maintains the path-independent folding of Ail and retains the Ail barrel under thermodynamic equilibrium; (iv) once folded, W42X mutants show resistance to chemical denaturation, giving rise to the apparent hysteresis; (v) due to the apparent hysteresis, stability of folded Ail follows the order W42X &gt; WT &gt; W149X, where X = F\/Y\/A. Overall, we find that W 42  is required for Ail folding, while W 149 contributes considerably to the stability of the folded Ail barrel. Additionally, we conclude that the observed hysteresis in Ail is driven primarily by the substitution of W 42 . In other words, W 42  contributes to the activation energy barrier for Ail (un)folding. A recent study identified the role of negative charges in the occurrence of hysteresis in the E. coli β -barrel OmpLA [34]. Our results with Ail add to this finding by showing the importance of interfacial tryptophans for thermodynamic equilibrium and path-independent (un)folding of outer membrane proteins. The observed hysteresis upon substitution of W 42  might arise from several factors (e.g., the formation of non-native contacts in the folded Ail W42X barrel, the population of unique unfolding intermediate(s), etc.). To further understand the unique molecular features of W 149  (W42X mutants), we carried out detailed spectroscopic measurements to check the local environments of both tryptophans.\n\n## 5.4 Hyperfluorescent intermediate in the Ail unfolding pathway reveals the likely formation of a molten globule\n\nThe significant contribution of Trp residues to folding and stability of Ail directed us to investigate the local environment of W 42  and W 149 . Typically, an equilibrium unfolding profile shows transition of protein from the folded state (RF) to the unfolded state (UF). Here, Ail transitions cooperatively from the unfolded to the folded state between 2.0 M-4.0 m GdnHCl. We have categorized the [GdnHCl] at the start and end of this cooperative transition as partially unfolded (PAR-UF*) and partially folded (PAR-RF) conformations, respectively. We reasoned that at these intermediate [GdnHCl], the protein conformation resembles neither the fully folded nor the fully unfolded states of Ail. The schematic shown in Fig. 6 illustrates the folded (RF), partially unfolded (PAR-UF*), partially folded (PARRF), and unfolded (UF) states of the protein (we use this nomenclature merely to simplify our explanation of the complex protein folding process). The fluorescence properties of each state changes on the basis of extent of unfolding and solvent accessibility of the tryptophans.\n\nWhen exposed to a chemical denaturant such as GdnHCl, Ail shows unfolding as well as a proportional decrease in the fluorescence intensity (Fig. S9). By and large, folded Ail WT and the W149X mutants exhibit the anticipated decrease in Trp emission in the order RF → PAR-UF* → PAR-RF → UF (Fig. 5, middle and right panels). However, the W42X mutants show ~20% increase in the fluorescence intensity of the PAR-UF* state compared to RF state (Fig. 5A; left panel, 5B; right panel and S6B). The increase in fluorescence intensity of the W42X mutants in the PAR-UF* state suggests that at this intermediate concentration of ~2.4 m GdnHCl, W 149  experiences a change in its local environment where it occludes GdnHCl. In other words, the vicinity of W 149  transitions to a buried (lipidsolvated) hyperfluorescent state before barrel unfolding commences. Prolonged incubation of the W42X mutants in ~2.4 m GdnHCl does not alter the spectral properties, suggesting that this hyperfluorescent species is stable and under equilibrium. Absence of detectable hyperfluorescence during the unfolding of Ail WT and W149X suggests that formation of this species is modulated uniquely by W 149 .\n\nFar-UV CD, fluorescence, and HSQC measurements confirm that the folded state of the W42X mutants is nearly identical to Ail WT (see Fig. 1C, 2, and S4). We further characterized this hyperfluorescent intermediate using CD. We find a possible variation in the rigidity of W 42 and W 149 , and different local environments for the indole rings in the folded proteins (Fig. S13). Additionally, the hyperfluorescent species (PAR-UF* state at ~2.4 m GdnHCl) in the W42X mutants shows an increased β -sheet content (Fig. S14). This suggests a possible change in the DPC-Ail interaction when only W 149  is retained, giving rise to an observable hyperfluorescent intermediate.\n\nTo obtain better insight into the spectral characteristics of W 149 , we carried out an in-depth fluorescence analysis. First, we examined indole accessibility and quenching efficiency by measuring the Stern-Volmer constant (K  SV ) and bimolecular quenching constant (k  q ). In addition, we monitored indole rigidity using anisotropy (r), and the rotational correlation time ( τ c ), and compared the results with Trp lifetimes (&lt; τ &gt;). A typical unfolding pro fi le of Ail W42F is presented in Fig. 6A, indicating different species in the unfolding titration, as the protein transitions from RF to PAR-UF*, PAR-RF, and UF states. We compared various\n\nparameters for all the mutants from both the unfolding and the folding profiles (Fig. 6B-D, Table S4).\n\nAs anticipated, we observe an increase in K  SV  and k  q  for WT and the W149X mutants upon unfolding, while the corresponding r,&lt; τ &gt;, and τ c are lowered (Table S4). Remarkably, the partially unfolded hyper-fluorescent intermediate (PAR-UF* in Fig. 6 left panel) seen in the unfolding equilibrium for W42X mutants at ~2.4 m GdnHCl displays lowered K  SV , and k  q ; the corresponding values of r,&lt; τ &gt;, and τ c are anomalous and higher than WT in the mutants possessing only W 149  (Fig. 6B-D and S8, Table S4). The lowered accessibility of the W 149  fluorophore and the associated increase in W 149 lifetime values reaffirms our initial deduction that at GdnHCl concentrations ≈ 2.4 M, W 149 adopts a solvent-occluded lipid-solvated environment. This lipidsolvated state gives rise to the hyperfluorescence that we observe in the equilibrium titrations, and is coupled with an anomalous anisotropy value (also see Fig. S14 for changes in near-UV CD). Such a hyperfluorescent state is not the result of a spatially proximal quencher, as K  SV  and k  q would be unaffected by static quenchers [29]. Further, we observe negligible differences in the data of W42F\/Y\/A mutants, suggesting that the nature of the amino acid at the 42nd position has no impact on the formation of the hyperfluorescent intermediate. Overall, on the basis of K  SV , k  q , r, τ c , and &lt; τ &gt; measurements, we conclude that the removal of W 42 and retention of W 149  is necessary and sufficient for the formation of this hyperfluorescent species.\n\nThe change in spectral properties of W 149  may arise due to (i) stronger detergent-indole interaction in the PAR-UF* state, or (ii) change in the local environment of W 149  to a buried state. In other words, the buried and solvent excluded conformation of W 149  could either be due to micelle expansion, protein compaction, or an increase in the secondary structure of the barrel. Based on our observations, we postulate that the quencher-inaccessible state of W 149  could resemble a molten globule-like conformation formed during Ail unfolding. Further, this lipid-anchoring property of W 149  may be crucial to establish strong protein-lipid interactions that influence Ail unfolding. Interestingly, the hyperfluorescent intermediate is W 149 -dependent and occurs only in the W42X proteins, is absent in W149X wherein only W 42  is retained, and is masked in WT Ail wherein both the tryptophans are present (see Fig. S14, S15). Therefore, we reason that the hysteresis in Ail W42X mutants arises due to a change in detergent-protein interactions in these proteins, and the intrinsic hyperfluorescence of W 149  is the consequence of the lipid-solvated state of the W 149  indole. We also conclude that the change in spectroscopic properties of W 149  is effected despite conserved substitutions at W 42 .\n\nFinally, we conclude from our observations that Ail undergoes a conformational transition upon GdnHCl-mediated denaturation, and unfolds via a stable hyperfluorescent unfolding intermediate. Occurrence of this hyperfluorescent intermediate gives rise to the apparent hysteresis in the unfolding of Ail W42X mutants. The absence of detectable intermediate for WT and W149X suggests that the lipid anchoring properties of W 149  leads to a change in its fluorescence property by alterations in the detergent-protein interaction. The latter drives the local environment of W 149  to a solvent-occluded lipid solvated environment in the unfolding transition. Similar molten globule-like structures are rare for membrane proteins,\n\nand detailed characterization of their structure will help in understanding membrane protein folding, unfolding, and function.\n\n## 6 Discussion\n\nUnderstanding the mechanism of transmembrane β -barrel folding is important to deduce the significance of evolutionary selection of each unique polypeptide sequence in balancing protein structure, stability, and its function. Despite the several excellent reports on OMP folding, most of the studies use E. coli proteins (e.g., OmpA [10,11,20], OmpX [21.29], PagP [12], OmpLA [22], FomA [23]). Membrane proteins are known to exhibit speciesdependent variations in their folding mechanism [17-19]. Hence, we reasoned that it is important to study the assembly of atypical OMPs. Here, we study the folding, stability, and unfolding pathway of the attachment invasion locus (Ail) protein β -barrel from the category A pathogen Y. pestis. Our study on the role of interfacial tryptophans on the folding of Ail has revealed the unexpected finding that, unlike bacterial and mitochondrial (VDAC2 [24]) OMPs that require tryptophans to critically aid their folding [10.20.21.24.29], interface tryptophans are neither important for the initial process of Ail assembly nor the early events of Ail unfolding. Additionally, our kinetics measurements show that Ail employs a multistep folding and assembly pathway, known to exist primarily in OMP folding in bilayer membranes [10,14], but is rare for OMPs in micelles [16].\n\nOur study also reveals that specific interface tryptophans of Ail contribute to the final barrel rearrangement process, to the post-folding stability, and to the unfolding. In particular, W 42 is more important than W 149  for the late events in Ail folding and barrel rearrangement. W 149  is crucial for post-folding stability of the Ail scaffold, as it forms strong protein-lipid interactions. Such distinction imparts differential importance to each tryptophan in the Ail scaffold, and demarcates this barrel from its E. coli analog OmpX [21]. We find that W 42 is required for the path-independent folding and thermodynamic stability of Ail. This is evident from the hysteresis observed when W 42  is substituted and only W 149  is retained. While the evolutionarily conserved W 149  establishes a strong intra-protein hydrophobic interaction network and contributes to barrel stability, W 42  not only forms a weaker interaction network, but is also poorly conserved in other OMPs (see Fig. S1). Our study assigns a specific role for W 42  in Ail, as vital for Ail folding kinetics and stability. The additive effect of both tryptophans on Ail stability correlates well with the evolutionary requirement of Ail for thermodynamic equilibrium, and to maintain plasticity in its structure [35,36]. OmpX (the structural analog of Ail in E. coli) possesses unusually high stability compared to Ail, but is functionally inactive. Therefore, we are tempted to suggest that the evolutionary selection of W 42  in the Ail sequence for structural plasticity may additionally bear significance. Further studies in this direction are, however, needed.\n\nInterestingly, hysteresis is unique only to the W 42  mutants, indicating that the pathdependence of the unfolding event (and the associated apparent free energy values ( Δ \/u1D43A app 0, \/u1D448 ) is imposed by the mutation (see Fig. 4A), and is not a consequence of the folding conditions. The occurrence of hysteresis in Ail unfolding provides a unique opportunity to map the hyperfluorescent state and to study the folding and unfolding pathways of Ail independently. Based on the results, we propose a plausible model both\n\nfor Ail assembly and Ail unfolding. Here, the folding of Ail can be divided into (i) early folding phase that occurs within seconds, and (ii) final barrel rearrangement that occurs over several minutes-hours. The initial folding phase is Trp-independent and does not involve changes in the local environment of the two interface indoles. While the multi-step folding and unfolding kinetics we see for Ail, is reported thus far only for OmpA [16], our results are also in good agreement with the overall assembly mechanisms proposed for OMPs [8,10,16,37]. The anchoring property attributed to the indole side chain is relevant only after the initial barrel assembly is completed. The rearrangement process is now Trp-dependent and is mediated by the interplay of W 42  and W 149  (Fig. 7).\n\nNotably, the folding process in vivo requires the barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex, which acts as the chaperone. On the other hand, OMP unfolding is BAMindependent. Our observation of the novel hyperfluorescent intermediate provides the first experimental data that differentiates the unfolding process from folding. Thermodynamic studies of OMP folding are preferably carried out in conditions that facilitate path independence. Hence, molecular factors that selectively drive OMP unfolding are usually considered in similar lines as the folding events. The occurrence of hysteresis as a consequence of this hyperfluorescent intermediate in Ail provides us with the first unique opportunity to study the molecular steps involved in the unfolding of an OMP. We find that Ail unfolding is nucleated in the vicinity of W 42 , and progresses towards W 149  (the post-folding anchor). The anchoring ability of W 149  resist barrel unfolding and gives rise to the hyperfluorescent species before unfolding is complete. Hyperfluorescence is usually the signature of a folding intermediate that is thermodynamically stabilized [38]. A similar molten globule-like flexible state has been observed for ankyrin-repeat protein, ubiquitin, and yeast phosphoglycerate kinase [38-40], but has not yet been reported for any OMP.\n\nThe occurrence of hyperfluorescence in the unfolding pathway in vivo and the significance of this state is yet to be established. The latter will require novel sophisticated methods for direct detection of OMP folding in the Yersinia outer membrane. Nonetheless, we speculate based on our current observations, that W 42  and W 149  are likely to play vital roles in the folding and anchoring, respectively, of Ail in the Yersinia outer membrane. A recent report on the folding pathway of the OmpA barrel in varying lipidic conditions highlights the relevance of results obtained from in vitro studies to the mechanism by which OMP assembly takes place in the cell [8,37]. Similar studies with other atypical OMPs can lead to the identification of other molten-globule like intermediate states, and provide novel insights into the unfolding pathway of kinetically stabilized OMPs. Our findings on Ail will serve as an excellent starting point to further understand the parallel (complex) folding and unfolding mechanisms of other biologically important OMPs from pathogenic bacteria, and mitochondria.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nA.G. thanks IISER Bhopal for research fellowship.

Naganathan , *\n\nDepartment of Biotechnology, Bhupat &amp; Jyoti Mehta School of Biosciences, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai 600036, India\n\n## Abstract\n\nThe dimensions of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are sensitive to small energetic-entropic differences between intramolecular and protein-solvent interactions. This is commonly observed on modulating solvent composition and temperature. However, the inherently heterogeneous conformational landscape of IDPs is also expected to be influenced by mutations that can (de)stabilize pockets of local and even global structure, native and non-native, and hence the average dimensions. Here, we show experimental evidence for the remarkably tunable landscape of IDPs by employing the DNA-binding domain of CytR, a high-sequence-complexity IDP, as a model system. CytR exhibits a range of structure and compactness upon introducing specific mutations that modulate microscopic terms, including main-chain entropy, hydrophobicity, and electrostatics. The degree of secondary structure, as monitored by far-UV circular dichroism (CD), is strongly correlated to average ensemble dimensions for 14 different mutants of CytR and is consistent with the Uversky-Fink relation. Our experiments highlight how average ensemble dimensions can be controlled via mutations even in the disordered regime, the prevalence of nonnative interactions and provide testable controls for molecular simulations.\n\nMutational perturbation of protein structures reveals position-specific and context-dependent information on protein structure network, folding, function, allostery, and epistasis. 1-4  A majority of studies have been performed on ordered proteins with a compact hydrophobic core and a well-defined three-dimensional structure. 5-8  However, elementary considerations of the intraprotein interaction or contact network highlight that mutations should not only modulate the folded versus unfolded state equilibrium but also tune the relative population of intermediate and excited states and thus the overall dimensions of the native ensemble. 4,9 Even small volume fluctuations are expected as the packing interaction can be weakened via specific mutations without changing the overall structure. 12  Testing this on folded proteins is\n\nThis is an open access article published under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the author and source are cited.\n\n* Corresponding Author : athi@iitm.ac.in.\n\nNotes\n\na huge challenge as small changes in dimensions are difficult to extract from conventional experiments.\n\nIntrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), on the other hand, provide a wonderful testing bed for probing mutation-driven structural perturbations. 13  High-sequence-complexity IDPs, i.e., those protein sequences that are disordered despite exhibiting little compositional bias, are more interesting as they are expected to populate pockets of local structure, rich in native or non-native interactions (deduced from the folded conformation), apart from fully disordered states. For example, this can be observed in studies of denatured states of folded proteins. 14-16  It should, therefore, be possible to tune the dimensions of natural IDPs through small perturbations of basic thermodynamic factors including backbone conformational entropy, hydrophobicity, and charge-charge interactions, that (de)stabilize pockets of structure.\n\nThe CytR DNA-binding domain (referred to as CytR hereon) is a high-sequence-complexity IDP that acquires a compact three-helix bundle structure in the presence of DNA (Figure 1A). 17 The conformational ensemble of CytR is sensitive to temperature, 18  salt, 19  and DNA, 17,19 all of which arise from a combination of destabilizing electrostatics (Figure 1B) and weak packing in the folded conformation. 20  In this work, we control the dimensions of the disordered CytR via a combination of folded structure and sequence-alignment-based expectations, and rational engineering. Though we observe nonintuitive effects, a likely manifestation of non-native interactions within the disordered ensemble, we find a strong correlation between secondary structure and the apparent Stokes radius (R  s ), a first such observation in IDPs.\n\nWe have shown earlier that the P33A mutation in CytR reduces the secondary structure content by reducing the population of an excited folded-like conformation. 21  Main-chain entropic considerations 22  suggest that, if an amino acid with a higher flexibility is introduced at the same position, the secondary structure content is expected to be even lower, arising from the larger entropic destabilization of residual structure. True to this, the thermal dependence of the P33G mutant's CD signal is flat (blue in Figure 2A) unlike the weak structural transitions observed in the WT or the P33A mutant (red and green in Figure 2A, respectively). In addition to the secondary structure content, the mean dimensions as measured by R  s  (in a calibrated size-exclusion chromatography column 20 ), shows a trend where P33G is more expanded than the WT (Figure 2B). Another interesting position is residue K35 located in the electrostatically frustrated binding site of the folded conformation with a number of positive charges around it (Figure 1B). Eliminating this positive charge through the K35Q mutant not only enhances the secondary structure content (though only marginally) but also reduces the dimensions of the ensemble (cyan in Figure 2).\n\nSimilarly, we have shown recently that the double mutant A29V\/A48M (DM; that introduces two large hydrophobic substitutions in the protein core) promotes collapse of the disordered ensemble into a compact folded ensemble while simultaneously increasing the secondarystructure content (mutations identified via sequence comparisons; magenta in Figure 2 and Supporting Figure S1). 20  Building on the folded-like conformation of the DM, we engineered two other mutants, Quad (A29V\/A48M\/R43A\/K46A; black in Figure 2) and Pent (A29V\/A48M\/R43A\/K46A\/R28A; gray in Figure 2), that further eliminate the residual\n\nelectrostatic frustration. These two mutants again promote structure and compaction while differentially affecting the secondary structure content. However, our attempts to rationally engineer structure or loss of structure were not always successful. For example, the A29V mutant enhances the structure-compactness only in the presence of the R28Q substitution and not otherwise (dark cyan in Figure 3A). Thus, collapse and structure acquisition in polymer chains is an emergent property arising from long-range many-body effects that can be engineered not only via hydrophobicity (as shown before for the DM) but also via a combination of hydrophobicity and electrostatics (A29V\/R28Q mutant).\n\nInterestingly, a number of single-point mutations (R28Q, A29V, D34S, R43N, R43E, K46A, and A48M) modulate ensemble dimensions despite being disordered (Figure 3A,B). The average dimensions of CytR can be mutationally varied from ~22 Å in the P33G mutant to ~16 Å in the Pent mutant (Figure 3B; Figure S2 for the elution profiles). If one excludes DM, Quad, and Pent that induce large structural changes, the maximal change in Stokes radius is ~3.5 Å , which is still significant as it corresponds to ~40% reduction in the volume of the protein chain compared to the fully unfolded P33G mutant.\n\nMutations that eliminate unfavorable interactions (R43N, R43E, K46A) as expected from the folded conformation still result in an expansion of the ensemble, suggestive of nonnative interactions in the disordered state (Figure 3B). The only exceptions to this are the R28Q and K35Q mutations that promote slight compaction and the D34S mutation that promotes slight expansion, upon elimination of unfavorable and favorable interactions, respectively (Figure 3B). Despite these varied outcomes on mutations, we find that it is possible to collapse all such variations into a single plot of ensemble dimensions versus secondary-structure content (Figure 3C; r = 0.96 and p &lt;10 -9 ). In fact, the dependence of relative CD signals on the relative molecular volumes agrees reasonably well with the Uversky-Fink relation 23  (Figure S3). We also observe a similar correlation between dimensions and secondary-structure content at different salt concentrations for the CytR WT combining SEC and analytical ultracentrifugation data (Figure S4). These observations are strong evidence that the magnitude of the far-UV CD signal at 222 nm (in absolute units) for a given protein can be an intimate indicator of the molecular dimension even in the disordered regime, 24  particularly for helical protein domains, and if appropriately calibrated.\n\nIs the correlation between Stokes radius and secondary structure a manifestation of (de)population of only folded-like conformations upon mutation? To answer this, we modeled the conformational behavior of CytR and its mutants via the semiquantitative Wako-Saitô-Muñoz-Eaton (WSME) statistical mechanical model that considers an ensemble of 2 47  microstates (47 being the length of the folded region of CytR) 25,26  with contributions from packing interactions, electrostatics, and implicit solvation. 27,28  Since the model is Go-like, 29  it captures the effect of only those mutations that display nativestructure-derived expectations (Figure 2 and Table S1). The predicted unfolding curves are very similar to experimental observations, both in terms of the order of stability and structure (Figure 4A), validating the model energetics and assumptions. All of the generated free-energy profiles display multiple minima whose relative populations are modulated on mutation (Figure 4B,C). This is also consistent with both explicit and implicit-solvent simulations of WT CytR that highlight a flat conformational landscape with numerous\n\ncompeting sub-states. 18,30  In fact, even the folded-like DM displays broad, weakly cooperative, and probe-dependent unfolding. 20  Taken together, our observations suggest that the apparent Stokes radius represents an effective ensemble average of numerous partially structured states.\n\nThe solvent sensitivity of IDP dimensions arises from small imbalances between intrachain and chain-solvent interactions. 15,16,31-34  In this work, we tune this relative balance by introducing mutations in a high-sequence-complexity IDP, and thus indirectly affecting the solvent quality (as seen by the polymer chain) without modulating solvent composition. Our results establish that the average dimensions of CytR can be modulated via mutations in a continuous manner through both rational engineering and non-native effects. CytR and its mutants can thus serve as excellent model systems for simulations, and to particularly validate force-fields and water models without resorting to extreme solvent conditions or temperature.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\n## Funding\n\nThis work was supported by the Wellcome Trust\/DBT India Alliance Intermediate Fellowship IA\/I\/15\/1\/501837 awarded to A.N.N.\n\n## Abbreviations\n\nCytR\n\ncytidine repressor\n\nWT\n\nwild-type\n\nCD\n\ncircular dichroism\n\nMRE\n\nmean residue ellipticity\n\nR s\n\nStokes radius\n\nIDP\n\nintrinsically disordered protein\n\nWSME\n\nWako-Saitô-Muñoz-Eaton","label":[[1283,1301,"Measure"],[1303,1305,"Measure"],[11478,11480,"Measure"],[11482,11500,"Measure"]],"Comments":[]}

Heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) is one of these mitochondrial molecular chaperones and has been proposed to play a pivotal role in the regulation of protein folding and the prevention of protein aggregation. However, the physiological function of HSP60 in mammalian tissues is not fully understood. Here we generated an inducible cardiac-speci \/uniFB01 c HSP60 knockout mouse model, and demonstrated that HSP60 deletion in adult mouse hearts altered mitochondrial complex activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ROS production, and eventually led to dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and lethality. Proteomic analysis was performed in puri \/uniFB01 ed control and mutant mitochondria before mutant hearts developed obvious cardiac abnormalities, and revealed a list of mitochondrial-localized proteins that rely on HSP60 (HSP60-dependent) for correctly folding in mitochondria. We also utilized an in vitro system to assess the effects of HSP60 deletion on mitochondrial protein import and protein stability after import, and found that both HSP60-dependent and HSP60-independent mitochondrial proteins could be normally imported in mutant mitochondria. However, the former underwent degradation in mutant mitochondria after import, suggesting that the protein exhibited low stability in mutant mitochondria. Interestingly, the degradation could be almost fully rescued by a non-speci \/uniFB01 c LONP1 and proteasome inhibitor, MG132, in mutant mitochondria. Therefore, our results demonstrated that HSP60 plays an essential role in maintaining normal cardiac morphology and function by regulating mitochondrial protein homeostasis and mitochondrial function.\n\n## Introduction\n\nCardiac myocytes are enriched in mitochondria in order to generate the large amount of ATP required to maintain\n\nThese authors contributed equally: Feifei Fan, Yaoyun Duan, Feili Yang\n\nEdited by J.M.

This energy supply must be tightly regulated to effectively meet the demands of the heart, especially during periods of increased workload or adrenergic stimulation. In addition to being the core of energy metabolism in the cell, mitochondria also regulate many aspects of intermediate metabolism, calcium buffering, and other cellular processes such as apoptosis [1]. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction has been strongly associated with the onset and progression of various cardiac diseases including dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure [2, 3].\n\n* Ju Chen juchen@ucsd.edu\n\n* Kunfu Ouyang\n\nouyang\\_kunfu@pku.edu.cn\n\n- 1 School of Chemical Biology and Biotechnology, State Key Laboratory of Chemical Oncogenomics, Peking University Shenzhen Graduate School, 518055 Shenzhen, China\n- 2 Department of Medicine, School of Medicine, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA\n- 3 Shenzhen Peking University Hospital, 518055 Shenzhen, China\n- 4 Department of Pathophysiology, School of Medicine, Shenzhen University, 518055 Shenzhen, China\n- 5 Shenzhen People s Hospital, 518055 Shenzhen, China '\n\nAlthough mitochondria possess their own genome, most mitochondrial proteins are actually encoded in the nucleus. More than 1200 proteins exist in mitochondria, but only 13 proteins are encoded by mammalian mitochondrial DNA [4, 5]. Nuclear-encoded mitochondrial precursor proteins have to be maintained in a relatively unfolded state in the cytosol for ef \/uniFB01 cient transportation into the mitochondria via the narrow pores formed by tightly gated translocons [6]. Thereafter, these proteins must be correctly folded inside the mitochondria to avoid unwanted protein-protein interactions or aggregation. Mitochondria have a dedicated repertoire of molecular chaperones located in both the intermembrane space (IMS) and matrix to promote ef \/uniFB01 cient mitochondrial protein folding and complex assembly. The mitochondrial chaperonin heat shock protein 60 (HSP60) consists of both HSP60 (the homologous GroEL Escherichia coli protein) and heat shock protein 10 (HSP10, the homologous GroES Escherichia coli protein) subunits, which form a barrel-shaped complex to primarily facilitate the folding of relatively small, soluble monomeric proteins [7, 8]. Mitochondrial HSP70 (mtHSP70), HSP90, and an HSP90 homolog Tumor Necrosis Factor ReceptorAssociated Protein-1 (TRAP-1), have also been shown to promote protein folding in mitochondria [9 -12].\n\nThe mitochondrial HSP60\/HSP10 complex is composed of two heptameric rings of the large subunit (HSP60) stacked back to back [13, 14]. The importance of this chaperonin complex has been highlighted in Escherichia coli and yeast, in which loss of either HSP60 or HSP10 results in a lethal phenotype [8, 15 -18]. Knockout experiments also demonstrated that HSP60 is essential for survival in Drosophila [19]. In mammals, however, the physiological roles of HSP60 and HSP10 in vivo have not been well studied. Deletion of HSP60 in mice leads to embryonic lethality shortly after implantation suggesting that HSP60 may be required for cell differentiation and survival during early embryonic development [20]. In humans, two diseaserelated missense mutations in HSP60 have been associated with a dominant form of hereditary spastic paraplegia and a recessively inherited white matter disorder called MitCHAP60 disease, respectively [21, 22]. In cardiac tissues, it has been shown that HSP60 expression was increased following heat stress and in end-stage heart failure [23, 24]. Furthermore, overexpression of HSP60, HSP10 or both in cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes protects cardiac cells from apoptotic cell death induced by simulated ischemia [25], ischemia\/reoxygenation [26, 27], or doxorubicin [28]. Although these studies strongly suggested that HSP60 could play an important function in cardiomyocytes, it remains unclear whether HSP60 is required for normal cardiac function in vivo. In the current study, we generated an inducible cardiac-speci \/uniFB01 c HSP60 knockout mouse (HSP60 CKO ) model and demonstrated that deletion of\n\nHSP60 in adult mouse cardiomyocytes resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure due to abnormal mitochondrial protein homeostasis and function.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n## Mice\n\nWe obtained the Hsp60 (MGI: 96242) embryonic stem cell clone containing conditional alleles with \/uniFB02 anked exon 3 and LacZ-Neo cassettes from the International Knockout Mouse Consortium (EUCOMM ID: 40427). To generate male chimeras we microinjected this construct into blastocysts from C57BL\/6 mice (Charles River). Male chimeras were then bred with female Black Swiss mice (Charles River) to generate germline-transmitted heterozygous ( Hsp60 \/uniFB02 ox-LacZ-Neo\/ + ) mice (Fig. S1A). The Hsp60 \/uniFB02 ox-LacZ-Neo\/ + mice were then crossed with B6.Cg-Tg (ACTFLPe)9205Dym\/J (FLPe) mice (The Jackson Laboratory) that express a \/uniFB02 ippase recombinase gene under the control of the human ACTB promoter [29], to remove the LacZ-Neo cassette and obtain Hsp60 \/uniFB02 oxed heterozygous ( Hsp60 f\/ + ) mice (Fig. S1B). To generate inducible cardiac-speci \/uniFB01 c Hsp60 knockout mice, Hsp60 f\/f mice were bred with α MHC-MerCreMer ( α MHC-MCM + ) transgenic mice that express a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase protein fused to two mutant estrogen receptor ligand binding domains [30]. α MHC-MCM + Hsp60 f\/ + mice were further crossed with Hsp60 f\/f mice to generate α MHCMCM + Hsp60 f\/f mice. To induce cardiac-speci \/uniFB01 c Hsp60 gene deletion, 7 -8-week-old male α MHC-MCM + Hsp60 f\/f mice were intraperitoneally injected with tamoxifen (20 mg\/kg\/d) for four consecutive days and considered cardiacspeci \/uniFB01 c Hsp60 knockout (HSP60 CKO ) mice. The littermate α MHC-MCM Hsp60 -f\/f mice were also treated with tamoxifen using the same procedure and used as control mice.\n\n## DNA analysis\n\nGenomic DNA was extracted from mouse tails as previously described [31], and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to genotype the offspring using the following gene-speci \/uniFB01 c primers (from 5 ′ to 3 ): ′ Hsp60 (Forward, TGGGTCAA GTACTTTTATCCCCTA; Reverse, GGGAAGGCTAAGA CCTACT CATT), α MHC-MerCreMer (Forward, GCCATA GGCTACGGTGTAAAAG; Reverse, TTGGTCAATAAGC CCATCATT).\n\n## Quantitative real-time PCR analysis\n\nQuantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed as previously described [32]. Brie \/uniFB02 y, total RNA was\n\nextracted from heart tissues with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and cDNA was synthesized using TransScript OneStep gDNA Removal and cDNA Synthesis SuperMix Kit (Transgen Biotech). qRT-PCR was performed using TransScript Tip Green qPCR SuperMix (Transgen Biotech) according to the manufacturer s ' instructions with each sample run at least in duplicate. Primer sequences used for qRT-PCR analysis can be found in Supplementary Table 1. Relative transcript abundance was normalized to Gadph as previously described [33].\n\n## Immunostaining\n\nHearts were freshly harvested, \/uniFB01 xed in 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), incubated with an ascending series of sucrose concentrations from 5 to 20%, and embedded in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound (Sakura Finetek USA Inc., Torrance, CA, USA). Cryosections (7 μ m) were prepared and immunostaining was performed using cleaved caspase 3 antibody (catalog no. 9661; Cell Signaling Technologies) as previously described [34].\n\n## Histological analysis\n\nHearts were freshly collected, \/uniFB01 xed in 4% paraformaldehyde diluted in PBS, dehydrated by ethanol, cleared in xylene, and embedded in paraf \/uniFB01 n wax. Serial sections (5 μ m) were obtained and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) as previously described [35]. Masson s Trichrome ' staining was performed according to the manufacturer s ' protocol (Sigma).\n\n## Mitochondria preparation\n\nHearts were freshly harvested, washed, minced, and homogenized in 10 volumes (v\/w) of Chapel-Perry buffer (in mM: 50 MOPS, 100 KCl, 5 MgSO4, 1 EGTA, and 1 ATP, pH 7.4) with a Polytron homogenizer at medium speed (5 s per time, four times). After centrifugation at 200 × g for 3 min, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged again at 300 × g for 4 min. After that, the supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 8000 × g for 17 min. The pellet was then resuspended and represented the mitochondrial fraction while the supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction.\n\n## Mitochondrial complexes activity assay\n\nThe activities of the individual mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) complexes I, II, and IV were determined immediately after isolating the mitochondrial fraction from control and HSP10 CKO hearts by using ETC complex activity microplate assay kits (complex I, catalog no.\n\nab109721; complex II, catalog no. ab109908; complex III, catalog no. ab109905; complex IV, catalog no. ab109911; Abcam). The signal was quanti \/uniFB01 ed using a spectrophotometer according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Complex I activity was determined by measuring the oxidation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to NAD + represented by the simultaneous reduction of a dye leading to increased absorbance at 450 nm. Complex II activity was measured as the reduction of ubiquinone to ubiquinol by a decrease in absorbance at 600 nm. Complex III activity was measured in a coupled reaction with a mixture solution containing succinate (electron donor of Complex II), oxidized cytochrome c (electron acceptor of complex III), KCN (Complex IV inhibitor) and rotenone (Complex I inhibitor). The rate of coupled Complex II + III reaction was measured by monitoring the conversion of oxidized cytochrome c into the reduced form, which can be observed as an absorbance increase at OD 550 nm. Complex IV activity was determined by following the oxidation of reduced cytochrome c as an absorbance decrease at 550 nm.\n\n## Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS production\n\nIsolation of single cardiomyocyte from adult mouse heart by Langendorff perfusion was performed as previously described [36]. Brie \/uniFB02 y, hearts were perfused with collagenase type II (catalog no. LS004177, Worthington) to dissociate individual cardiomyocytes. Isolated cells were then \/uniFB01 ltered through a 100μ m mesh nylon \/uniFB01 lter before performing sequential sedimentation to enrich for myocytes, and plated onto glass-covered dishes coated with Laminin. To measure mitochondrial membrane potential of individual cardiomyocytes, cells were incubated with 25 nM Tetramethylrhodamine (TMRM) (catalog no. T668, Thermo \/uniFB01 sher Scienti \/uniFB01 c) for 60 min at 37 °C, washed, and imaged by confocal microscopy using the light of 543 nm. To determine mitochondrial superoxide production, cells were incubated with 2 μ M MitoSOX ™ red mitochondrial superoxide indicator (catalog no. M36008, Thermo \/uniFB01 sher Scienti \/uniFB01 c) for 20 min at 37 °C, washed, and imaged at 514 nm. Data were analyzed using Image J software.\n\n## Western blotting\n\nFreshly isolated ventricles were homogenized in lysis buffer (20mM Tris-HCl, 20mM NaCl, 0.1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing a protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (catalog no. B15001; Biotool, USA). On the other hand, mitochondria were prepared separately as mentioned above and were\n\nhomogenized in the same lysis buffer to have subcellular mitochondrial fractions. Protein content was measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (catalog no. 23227; Pierce, USA) and adjusted for equal loading. Standard procedures were used to run protein samples on SDS-PAGE gels and subsequently transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). The primary antibodies utilized in this study can be found in Supplementary Table 2.\n\n## Echocardiography\n\nEchocardiography was performed as previously described [37]. Brie \/uniFB02 y, mice were anesthetized with 1% iso \/uniFB02 urane and underwent echocardiography using the Vevo 2100 ultrasound system (VisualSonics, FUJIFILM, Canada) with a linear transducer 32 -55 MHz. Percent fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) were used as indicators of systolic cardiac function. Measurements of heart rate (HR), left ventricular (LV) internal diameter at end-systole (LVIDs) and at end-diastole (LVIDd), LV posterior wall thickness at end-systole (LVPWs) and at end-diastole (LVPWd), and interventricular septal wall thickness at end-systole (IVSs) and at end-diastole (IVSd) were determined from the LV M-mode tracing.\n\n## Quantitative mitochondrial proteomics by LC-MS\/ MS\n\nHearts were collected from control and HSP60 CKO mice 6 weeks post tamoxifen injection. To minimize the variation of protein expression between animals, mitochondrial fractions isolated from three independent biological replicates were pooled for both control and HSP60 CKO samples, and submitted for proteomic analysis (PTM Biolabs, Hangzhou, China). One proteomic analysis per pooled sample was performed. In brief, mitochondrial fractions were sonicated three times on ice using a high intensity ultrasonic processor (Scientz, China) in lysis buffer (8.0M Urea, 10mM DTT, 2mM EDTA and 1% protease inhibitor cocktail III). Protein concentration was determined using the 2-D Quant kit (GE Healthcare Bioscience, USA) according to the manufacturer s ' instruction. For digestion, the protein solution was reduced with 10 mM DTT for 1 h at 37 °C, and alkylated with 20;mM iodoacetamide (IAA) in the dark for 45 min at room temperature. Following alkylation, protein samples were diluted to 1 M urea by adding 100mM triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). Finally, trypsin was added at 1:50 trypsin-to protein mass ratio for the \/uniFB01 rst digestion overnight and 1:100 trypsinto-protein mass ratio for a second 4 h digestion. Approximately 300 μ g protein for each sample was digested with trypsin for the following experiments. After trypsin digestion, the peptides were desalted using Strata X C18 SPE columns (Phenomenex, USA) and vacuum-dried. Peptides were reconstituted in 0.5 M TEAB and processed with the 6-plex TMT kit (Thermo \/uniFB01 sher Scienti \/uniFB01 c, USA) according to the manufacturer s instruction. ' After TMT labeling, the sample was fractionated by high pH reverse-phase HPLC using Agilent 300Extent C18 column (5 μ m particles, 4.6 mm ID, 250 mm length; Agilent, USA). Peptides were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (FA), directly loaded onto a reversed-phase pre-column (Acclaim PepMap 100; Thermo \/uniFB01 sher Scientifc, USA). Peptide separation was performed using a reversedphase analytical column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC; Thermo\/uniFB01 sher Scientifc, USA). The gradient was comprised of an increase from 6 to 22% solvent B (0.1% FA in 98% acetonitrile) over 26 min, 22 -35% in 8 min, and climbing to 80% in 3min then holding at 80% for the last 3 min, all at a constant \/uniFB02 ow rate of 300nl\/min on an EASY-nLC 1000 UPLC system. The resulting peptides were analyzed by Q Exactive TM Plus hybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo \/uniFB01 sher Scienti \/uniFB01 c, USA). The resulting MS\/MS data were processed using Mascot search engine (V2.3.0). Tandem mass spectra were searched against the Swissprot Mouse database. Trypsin\/P was speci \/uniFB01 ed as the cleavage enzyme allowing up to 2 missing cleavages. Mass error was set to 10 parts per million (ppm) for precursor ions and 0.02 Dalton (Da) for fragment ions. Carbamidomethyl on Cysteine, TMT6plex (N-term) and TMT-6plex (K) were speci \/uniFB01 ed as \/uniFB01 xed modi \/uniFB01 cations and oxidation on Methione was speci \/uniFB01 ed as variable modi \/uniFB01 cations. FDR was adjusted to &lt;1% and peptide ion score was set ≥ 20.\n\n## In vitro transcription and translation\n\nHuman in \/uniFB02 uenza hemagglutinin (HA) tag (TACCCAT ACGATGTTCCAGATTACGCT) was added at the Cterminus of the cDNA encoding mouse SIRT3. The constructed fragment was ampli \/uniFB01 ed by PCR and subsequently cloned into the vector pSP64 (Promega) at the restriction sites SmaI and HindIII . Plasmid DNA was added to an aliquot of the TnT ® Quick Master Mix (catalog no. L2080, Promega) and incubated in a 50 µl reaction volume for 60 -90 min at 30 °C to obtain HA-tagged proteins.\n\n## Mitochondrial protein import and degradation assay\n\nFreshly isolated mitochondria were suspended in import buffer (250 mM sucrose, 5 mM magnesium acetate, 80 mM potassium acetate, 10 mM sodium succinate, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM ADP, 20 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4). Mitochondrial protein concentrations were then measured using the BCA Protein Assay Kit. Subsequently, 50 μ g mitochondria were diluted in 200 μ l import buffer containing 10 mM ATP, followed by addition of 4 μ l HA-tagged preproteins, and incubated at 37 °C for 25 min. Mitochondrial protein import was stopped by addition of valinomycin\n\n(2.0 μ M) to dissipate mitochondrial membrane potential and subsequent centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Mitochondrial pellets were then resuspended in 200 μ l import buffer containing MG132 (50 μ M in DMSO) or vehicle (DMSO), and incubated for 50 min. After that, mitochondria were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (20mM Tris-HCl, 20mM NaCl, 0.1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (catalog no. B15001, Biotool).\n\n## Statistics\n\nScatter diagrams were drawn using Graphpad Prism 5. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-tailed, unpaired Student s ' t -test or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test for multiple comparisons (Graphpad Prism 5). All data represent mean ± SEM (error bars). P &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically signi \/uniFB01 cant.\n\n## Results\n\n## Generation of an inducible cardiac-speci \/uniFB01 c Hsp60 knockout mouse model\n\nTo understand the physiological role of HSP60 in adult hearts, we generated an inducible cardiac-speci \/uniFB01 c HSP60 knockout mouse model (Fig. S1; Fig. 1a). Seven to 8-weekold male α MHC-MCM Hsp60 + f\/f mice were treated with tamoxifen to delete Hsp60 and were used as cardiac-speci \/uniFB01 c Hsp60 knockout (HSP60 CKO ) mice. In the HSP60 CKO hearts, Hsp60 mRNA levels were dramatically reduced as early as 1 week post tamoxifen injection (Fig. 1b), suggesting that tamoxifen-induced gene deletion was fast and ef \/uniFB01 cient. Furthermore, HSP60 protein levels were almost completely abolished in mutant mice 11 weeks post tamoxifen injection (Fig. 1c, d). However, the decrease in HSP60 protein levels was slower than that of Hsp60 mRNA expression in HSP60 CKO hearts especially at the earlier time points post tamoxifen injection (Fig. 1d), implicating that HSP60 protein in adult cardiomyocytes has a relatively slow turnover rate (Fig. 1b -d). The expression of voltagedependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1), an outer mitochondrial membrane protein, used as the mitochondrial protein loading control, was not signi \/uniFB01 cantly changed between control and mutant hearts (Fig. S2A, B).\n\n## Deletion of HSP60 in adult cardiomyocytes resulted in lethality and cardiac chamber dilation\n\nIn contrast to control animals, all HSP60 CKO mice died within 14 weeks post tamoxifen injection (Fig. 2a), suggesting that HSP60 in adult cardiomyocytes is required for the survival of adult mice. The hearts collected from HSP60 CKO mice 11 weeks post tamoxifen treatment when the mice started to die were apparently enlarged (Fig. 2b). Histological analysis also revealed dramatic ventricular chamber dilation and ventricular wall thinning in HSP60 CKO hearts (Fig. 2b). Consistently, the ratio of ventricular weight to body weight and the ratio of lung weight to body weight were both signi \/uniFB01 cantly increased in HSP60 CKO mice at this time point (Fig. 2c). This is particularly important since an increase in the latter has regularly been used as a clinical indication of pulmonary edema due to heart failure [38]. Furthermore, mutant hearts displayed severe cardiac \/uniFB01 brosis, as indicated by interstitial collagen deposition (Fig. 2d, e). An increased number of apoptotic cells was also observed in mutant hearts at this time point (Fig. 2f, g), which was associated with increased expression of the proapoptotic protein BAX and reduced expression of the antiapoptotic protein BCL2 (Fig. S3A, B), indicating the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways in mutant hearts.\n\n## HSP60 CKO mice developed dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure\n\nWe also performed echocardiographic analysis to monitor the changes of cardiac morphology and function. No cardiac morphological and functional changes were observed in HSP60 CKO mice prior to 9 weeks after tamoxifen injection (Fig. 3a -h; Fig. S4A). At 9 weeks post tamoxifen injection, the left ventricle (LV) systolic function represented by fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) was slightly decreased in HSP60 CKO mice. However, cardiac morphology evidenced by ventricular wall thickness and internal dimension at this time point was not signi \/uniFB01 cantly altered in HSP60 CKO mice (Fig. 3a -h; Fig. S4B). The mass of mutant hearts and lungs were also not changed at 6 or 9 weeks post tamoxifen injection (Fig. S4C, D). Afterwards, enlarged LV chamber and ventricular wall thinning were found in HSP60 CKO mice 11 and 13 weeks after tamoxifen injection, which was consistent with the histological analysis (Fig. 2b). In addition, LV systolic function was further deteriorated in HSP60 CKO mice at these two stages, as indicated by further reduces in FS and EF (Fig. 3g, h). All these data demonstrated that HSP60 CKO mice developed dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure, which eventually resulted in the death of mutant mice.

A slight increase of ANF and β MHC expression was observed in HSP60 CKO hearts 6 weeks post tamoxifen injection (Fig. S6A-D), implicating that the change of cardiac fetal gene expression precedes alterations in cardiac morphology and function in HSP60 CKO hearts. Thereafter, the expression of all four cardiac fetal genes was signi \/uniFB01 cantly altered in HSP60 CKO hearts 9 weeks and 11 weeks post tamoxifen injection. Furthermore, expression of collagen1 α 1 , collagen3 α 1 , Tgfb , and cTgf were also signi \/uniFB01 cantly increased in HSP60 CKO hearts at these two stages (Fig. S6E-H).\n\n## Loss of HSP60 in cardiomyocytes altered mitochondrial function\n\nWe next examined the effects of HSP60 deletion on mitochondrial functions. The enzymatic activities of all four complexes were measured in freshly isolated mitochondria by spectrophotometric analysis. At 6 weeks post tamoxifen injection, no signi \/uniFB01 cant difference was observed in the activities of all four complexes between control and mutant mitochondria (Fig. 4a -d). At 9 weeks post tamoxifen injection, the activities of complex I and complex III in HSP60 CKO mitochondria were signi \/uniFB01 cantly impaired, whereas the activities of complex II and complex IV were not signi \/uniFB01 cantly altered at this time point (Fig. 4a -d). Later on, the activities of all four complexes in HSP60 CKO mitochondria were signi \/uniFB01 cantly impaired 11 weeks post tamoxifen injection (Fig. 4a -d). We also measured mitochondrial potential and production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistent with the changes in complex activities, reduced mitochondrial potential and increased mitochondrial ROS levels were observed in HSP60 CKO cardiomyocytes at 9 weeks post tamoxifen injection but not at 6 weeks post tamoxifen injection (Fig. 4e, f).\n\n## Deletion of HSP60 perturbed mitochondrial protein homeostasis\n\nTo further understand the effects of HSP60 deletion on cardiac mitochondrial protein homeostasis, we performed\n\nFig. 2 Deletion of HSP60 in adult cardiomyocytes results in mouse lethality and dilated cardiomyopathy. a Survival curves of control ( n = 12) and HSP60 CKO ( n = 16) mice after tamoxifen injection.

In total, 2194 proteins were quanti \/uniFB01 ed, among which 676 proteins, accounting for about 30% of total identi \/uniFB01 ed proteins, were considered as the mitochondrial-localized proteins according to the online mitochondrial protein database including MitoCarta [5], MitoMiner [39], and the UniProt annotation, while the other detected proteins represented co-purifying contaminants. These 676 mitochondrial proteins could be divided into 14 subgroups according to their functional classi \/uniFB01 cation (Fig. 5a), among which 80 proteins were identi \/uniFB01 ed as components of mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC; Table S3). When setting the quanti \/uniFB01 cation ratio of &gt;1.5 as the upregulated threshold and &lt;0.67 as the downregulated threshold, 121 mitochondrial-localized proteins were downregulated and only eight mitochondrial-localized proteins were upregulated in HSP60 CKO sample relative to the control sample (Table S4), in which most downregulated proteins were involved in processes such as lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and RNA\/DNA\/protein synthesis (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, 10 ETC proteins were downregulated in mutant sample, all of which belong to ETC complex I (Table S3), implicating that complex I components might be more susceptible to HSP60 de \/uniFB01 ciency than the other complexes.\n\nIndividually, the ratio of HSP60 protein in mutant mitochondria to the control is 0.278 (Fig. 5c), which is very close to 32.4% as revealed by western blotting (Fig. 1d). VDAC1 that was used as the mitochondrial protein loading control was also not different between mutant and control samples (Fig. 5c). Western blotting analysis was further performed to validate the reliability of the proteomic data, and revealed that protein levels of SUCLG2, LDHD, CPT2, ALDH2, BCKDHB, SIRT3, RTN4IP1, and OXCT1 were all signi \/uniFB01 cantly decreased in mutant mitochondria at\n\nFig. 3 Echocardiographic assessment of cardiac morphology and function in control and HSP60 CKO mice.

Mitochondria were isolated from control and HSP60 CKO hearts at 6 weeks (6w) and 11 weeks (11w) post tamoxifen injection, and total 10 proteins including HSP60, SUCLG2, LDHD, CPT2, ALDH2, BCKDHB, SIRT3, RTN4IP1, OXCT1, and VDAC1 were analyzed by western blot\n\n6 weeks post tamoxifen injection, which was also consistent with the proteomic analysis (Fig. 5c, d; Fig. S7A). Furthermore, these eight proteins were further reduced in mutant mitochondria 11 weeks post tamoxifen injection, which coincided well with the change of HSP60 protein level between these two stages (Fig. 1c). Therefore, these data suggested our proteomic data are highly reliable, further validating our \/uniFB01 ndings about the deleterious effects of HSP60 deletion on mitochondrial protein levels.\n\n## Loss of HSP60 altered mitochondrial protein quality control\n\nWe further investigated the mechanisms underlying the downregulation of mitochondrial proteins by HSP60 deletion. First, mRNA levels of Suclg2 , Ldhd , Cpt2 , Aldh2 , Bckdhb , Sirt3 , Rtn4ip1 , and Oxct1 genes were not signi \/uniFB01 cantly altered between control and HSP60 CKO hearts at 6 weeks post tamoxifen injection (Fig. S7B), suggesting that HSP60 deletion in cardiomyocytes did not change the transcription pro \/uniFB01 le of these genes. We next examined whether HSP60 deletion could result in increases of unfolded or misfolded proteins and subsequent protein degradation. In mitochondria, an increase in unfolded or misfolded proteins will trigger the mitochondrial unfolded protein responses (UPR mt ) to increase chaperone capacity and re-establish homeostasis within the mitochondrial protein-folding environment [40]. Therefore, we measured the expression of mtHsp70 and Chop , two molecular markers of UPR mt in control and HSP60 CKO hearts. However, no signi \/uniFB01 cant difference in expression of mt Hsp70 and Chop was found between control and HSP60 CKO hearts 6 weeks post tamoxifen injection (Fig. 6a), suggesting that no obvious UPR mt was induced in the mutant hearts at this time point. We also investigated the effects of HSP60 deletion on the expression of mitochondrial proteases. At least two types of ATP-dependent proteases, Lon and ClpXP, are localized in the mitochondrial matrix in various organisms [41, 42]. The level of LONP1, a major member of Lon protease family, was not signi \/uniFB01 cantly altered in HSP60 CKO hearts 6 weeks post tamoxifen injection (Fig. 6b, c). In addition, the level of HTRA2, a serine protease located in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and released from mitochondria during apoptosis [43, 44], was also not signi \/uniFB01 cantly changed in mutant hearts at this time point (Fig. 6b, c). In contrast, the level of CLPP, a proteolytic subunit of the ClpXP protease, was signi \/uniFB01 cantly reduced in HSP60 CKO hearts at this time point, which is\n\nFig. 6 Assessment of mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR mt ) and mitochondrial protease expression in control and HSP60 CKO hearts. a Mitochondrial UPR mt was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR analysis of mtHsp70 and Chop mRNA levels in control and HSP60 CKO hearts at 6 weeks (6w), 9 weeks (9w) and 11 weeks (11w) post tamoxifen injection. n = 6 7 mice per group. -b c , Western\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nblotting ( b ) and quantitative analysis ( c ) of mitochondrial proteases including CLPP, LONP1, and HTRA2 in control and HSP60 CKO hearts at 6 weeks, 9 weeks and 11 weeks post tamoxifen injection. n = 3 6 mice per group. All Data represent mean ± SEM. Signi -\/uniFB01 cance was determined using the two-way ANOVA analysis with Bonferroni posthoc test. * p &lt; 0.05, *** p &lt; 0.001 versus control\n\nconsistent with what we found by proteomic analysis (Fig. 5c; Fig. 6b, c).\n\nWe also set up different in vitro systems to assess the effects of HSP60 deletion on mitochondrial protein degradation. Neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCMs) and cardiac \/uniFB01 broblasts (NCFs) were isolated from HSP60 f\/f mice, cultured and treated with adenovirus-Cre (Adv-Cre). Adv-Cre treatment was able to reduce Hsp60 mRNA levels but not protein levels in NCMs (Fig. S8), probably because HSP60 protein has a relatively long turnover time in NCMs, as is the case in adult cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1c, d). In NCFs, AdvCre treatment ef \/uniFB01 ciently reduced both HSP60 mRNA and protein levels (Fig. S9A, B). Furthermore, HSP60 deletion also reduced expression of SIRT3 and SUCLG2 in NCFs (Fig. S9B). More importantly, addition of MG132, an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome also known to enter mitochondria where it can inhibit LONP1 [45, 46], signi \/uniFB01 cantly rescued the downregulation of SIRT3 and SUCLG2 protein in Adv-Cre-treated NCFs (Fig. S9C, D).\n\nTo further assess the contribution of cardiac mitochondria to protein degradation, we isolated mitochondria from control and HSP60 CKO hearts 6 weeks post tamoxifen injection, and performed protein import and degradation assays using the in vitro generated HA-tagged SIRT3 and HA-tagged NDUFA9 (Fig. 7a). NDUFA9 is a complex I component and was examined as an HSP60-independent protein since its expression was not signi \/uniFB01 cantly changed in\n\nHSP60CKO mitochondria as revealed by both proteomics and western blot analyses (Table S4; Fig. S10A, B). We found that import of HA-tagged SIRT3 or HA-tagged NDUFA9 into control and HSP60 CKO mitochondria was comparable (Fig. 7b, c; Fig. S9C), suggesting that mitochondrial protein import was not affected by deletion of HSP60. In other words, downregulation of HSP60dependent proteins such as SIRT3 in mutant mitochondria was not a consequence of impaired mitochondrial protein import. Furthermore, no degradation of SIRT3 was observed in control mitochondria 50 min after import, whereas about 30% of imported protein had been degraded in mutant mitochondria within the same period (Fig. 7b, c). However, no degradation of NDUFA9 could be found in either control or HSP60 CKO mitochondria (Fig. S10C). Interestingly, addition of MG132 almost completely rescued SIRT3 degradation in mutant mitochondria (Fig. 7d, e). Taken together, these data strongly suggested that HSP60-dependent mitochondrial proteins could not be normally folded in mutant mitochondria and thus underwent protein degradation that mainly relied on LONP1.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn our present study, we used an inducible cardiac-speci \/uniFB01 c α MHC-MerCreMer system to delete HSP60 in adult mouse\n\nFig. 7 Measurement of protein import and degradation in isolated control and HSP60 CKO mitochondria.

We found that deletion of HSP60 led to cardiac chamber dilation and left ventricular dysfunction, accompanied with a dramatic increase in the ratio of lung to body weight, and premature death, demonstrating that HSP60 deletion in adult cardiomyocytes resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy, which further led to heart failure and lethality (Fig. S11). Although knockout experiments have shown that HSP60 is essential for the survival of Escherichia coli , yeast, Drosophila, and mice [8, 15 -20], the in vivo functions of HSP60 in cardiac physiology and diseases have not been well studied. Therefore, our present study provided evidence for the \/uniFB01 rst time, to our knowledge, that HSP60 plays an essential role in maintaining normal cardiac morphology and function in mice. On the other hand, deletion of HSP60 in adult mouse cardiomyocytes was also associated with an increase of cell apoptosis and cardiac \/uniFB01 brosis in the hearts, which is also consistent with a previous study showing that reduced HSP60 expression could increase cell apoptosis in cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes [47].\n\nThe HSP60 chaperonin is located in the matrix and consists of both HSP60 and HSP10 subunits to form a barrel-shaped complex that has been suggested to facilitate folding of relatively small, soluble monomeric proteins [7, 8]. In Escherichia coli , ~250 different proteins were found to interact with GroEL (HSP60 from Escherichia coli ), among which only about 85 proteins exhibited an obligate dependence on GroEL for folding, suggesting that the others can utilize either GroEL or the other chaperones for folding [48]. In mammals, the effects of HSP60 loss on mitochondrial protein homeostasis remain unde \/uniFB01 ned.\n\nDeletion of HSP60 in mice resulted in a very early embryonic lethality [20], which makes it impossible to use homozygous mutant mice for further functional and biochemical studies. On the other hand, proteomic analysis of mitochondria from heterozygous mutant mice which express half level of HSP60 protein revealed that UQCRC1 and SOD2 were highly dependent on appropriate HSP60\/ HSP10 chaperone complex function [49, 50]. In our present study, we also performed proteomic analysis to identify effects of HSP60 deletion on mitochondrial protein homeostasis. We identi \/uniFB01 ed 2194 proteins in total, but only 676 proteins (30.8% of total identi \/uniFB01 ed proteins) were characterized as mitochondrial-localized proteins. This low percentage might largely arise from co-purifying contaminants that has been found to represent up to 75% of proteins detected in other MS\/MS experiments [51]. Among these 676 identi \/uniFB01 ed mitochondrial-localized proteins, 121 proteins were downregulated and only eight proteins were upregulated in the HSP60 CKO hearts relative to their control counterparts. Western blot analysis of a selected subset of proteins con \/uniFB01 rmed proteomic results. Therefore, here we provided for the \/uniFB01 rst time, at least to our knowledge, a list of mitochondrial proteins that require HSP60-mediated chaperone activity to maintain their protein levels in the mitochondria of adult mouse cardiomyocytes. We also believe it will be informative to determine which mitochondrial proteins bind directly to HSP60.\n\nMost components of ETC complexes were identi \/uniFB01 ed in our proteomic analysis including 38 proteins of complex I, four proteins of complex II, nine proteins of complex III, 13 proteins of complex IV, and 16 proteins of complex V. In HSP60 mutant mitochondria, 10 ETC components were downregulated relative to controls, all belonging to complex I, demonstrating that complex I components are more susceptible to the loss of HSP60 than the other complex components. These selective effects on complex I components may re \/uniFB02 ect speci \/uniFB01 city for interaction with HSP60, or may re \/uniFB02 ect overall greater protein \/uniFB02 ux within complex I components. Complex I is the largest and \/uniFB01 rst enzyme of the ETC, which is composed of 45 subunits and is essential for cellular energy production, providing about 40% of the proton motive force required for ATP synthesis [52].\n\nPerturbed mitochondrial protein homeostasis in mutant mice \/uniFB01 rst led to increased expression of cardiac fetal genes including ANF and β MHC 6 weeks post tamoxifen injection, suggesting that cardiac remodeling program was activated in mutant hearts even though UPR mt , mitochondrial dysfunction, and abnormalities in cardiac morphology and function were not observed in mutant hearts at this stage. Subsequently, UPR mt was observed at 9 weeks post tamoxifen injection, indicating that mutant mitochondria were not able to degrade unfolded proteins, which started to accumulate, and was accompanied with impaired complex I\n\nand complex III activity, reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, increased mitochondrial ROS production, and the emergence of reduced cardiac systolic function in mutant hearts. Later on, expression of LONP1 and HTRA2 was increased in mutant hearts, likely as a compensatory mechanism but still could not prevent mutant hearts from developing chamber dilation and heart failure in the end.\n\nInterestingly, downregulation of mitochondrial proteins in HSP60 CKO hearts 6 weeks post tamoxifen injection was not accompanied by reduced mRNA levels, suggesting that deletion of HSP60 does not affect transcription of these genes. Furthermore, mitochondrial import and degradation assays suggested that mitochondrial protein import was largely normal in mutant mitochondria, which was also consistent with the fact that we did not observe apparent changes in expression of the Translocases of Inner Mitochondrial Membrane (TIMMs) or the Translocases of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane (TOMMs) between control and mutant mitochondria in our proteomic data. We also did not observe any increases in expression of LONP1, CLPP, and HTRA2 in mutant mitochondria at the same stage. Our results further suggested that LONP1 may be the major protease responsible for protein degradation in mitochondria after HSP60 deletion, since addition of MG132, a LONP1 protease inhibitor [45, 46], rescued protein degradation in cell preparations as well as in mitochondrial preparations.\n\nTaken together, our study demonstrated that HSP60 is required for maintaining normal cardiac morphology and function. Loss of HSP60 in adult cardiomyocytes altered mitochondrial protein homeostasis, impaired mitochondrial function, and eventually resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure.\n\nAcknowledgements The authors would like to thank Heping Cheng (Peking University) and Shiqiang Wang for critical suggestions about experimental design, and Jennifer Veevers for critical reading of the manuscript.

India\n\n## Abstract\n\nDeducing the molecular details of membrane protein folding has lately become an important area of research in biology. Using Ail, an outer membrane protein (OMP) from Yersina pestis as our model, we explore details of β -barrel folding, stability, and unfolding. Ail displays a simple transmembrane β -barrel topology. Here, we find that Ail follows a simple two-state mechanism in its folding and unfolding thermodynamics. Interestingly, Ail displays multi-step folding kinetics. The early kinetic intermediates in the folding pathway populate near the unfolded state ( β T ≈ 0.20), and do not display detectable changes in the local environment of the two interface indoles. Interestingly, tryptophans regulate the late events of barrel rearrangement, and Ail thermodynamic stability. We show that W 149 → Y\/F\/A substitution destabilizes Ail by ~0.13-1.7 kcal mol -1 , but retains path-independent thermodynamic equilibrium of Ail. In surprising contrast, substituting W 42  and retaining W 149  shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium to an apparent kinetic retardation of only the unfolding process, which gives rise to an associated increase in scaffold stability by ~0.31.1 kcal mol -1 . This is accompanied by the formation of an unusual hyperfluorescent state in the unfolding pathway that is more structured, and represents a conformationally dynamic unfolding intermediate with the interface W 149  now lipid solvated. The defined role of each tryptophan and poorer folding efficiency of Trp mutants together presents compelling evidence for the importance of interface aromatics in the unique (un)folding pathway of Ail, and offers interesting insight on alternative pathways in generalized OMP assembly and unfolding mechanisms.\n\n## Keywords\n\nYersinia Ail; Aromatic girdle; Unfolding intermediate; Hyperfluorescence; Lipid-protein interaction\n\n* Coressponding author at: Molecular Biophysics Laboratory, Department of Biological Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Room #324, III Floor, Block C, Academic Bldg. 3, Bhauri, Bhopal 462066.

The folding microenvironment and key residues in the primary sequence play vital roles in the folding process of both transmembrane α -helices and β -barrels. Despite several efforts, we still lack a complete understanding of how transmembrane β -barrels assemble. The energy landscape of β -barrel folding is dictated by the primary sequence of protein (intramolecular interactions in the polypeptide), and the surrounding lipidic milieu [1]. Under physiological conditions, outer membrane β -barrel proteins (OMPs) of Gram-negative bacteria assemble through folding intermediates, and this process is assisted by the barrel assembly machinery [3,6,7]. However, OMPs retain the ability to fold independently in vitro. This property of OMPs facilitates the biophysical analysis of folding intermediates in barrel assembly, and the influence of the protein sequence on the folding pathway [7-9]. For example, the outer membrane β -barrel proteins (OMPs) OmpA and OmpX from Escherichia coli sample several short-lived partially folded conformations during folding, and achieve complete folding by a multi-step concerted mechanism [9-11]. These transient intermediates direct the nascent polypeptide to its folded state within biologically relevant timescales, while avoiding misfolding and aggregation [8,11]. The characterization of such intermediates is crucial to understand the folding energy landscape. However, the partially folded conformations are transient and do not accumulate under equilibrium conditions [9,11]. A two-state folding mechanism is therefore sufficient to explain, and is consistent with the thermodynamic equilibrium observed during OMP folding [8,11-13]. Primarily, the rate-limiting step is studied, where the unfolded and native states are separated by a large energy barrier.\n\nThe folding of OMPs requires a particularly intricate interplay of thermodynamic and kinetic elements that together define the conversion of the unfolded polypeptide into a biologically active and stable β -barrel conformation. While OMPs do exhibit thermodynamic equilibrium in vitro, it has been proposed that OMPs in the bacterial outer membrane are kinetically stabilized, as they possess high activation energy barrier for unfolding, and show slow equilibration in thermodynamic measurements [4,10,14,15]. It is believed that this kinetic stability is essential for OMPs to function in a constantly changing external environment. Owing to this kinetic stability, in vitro (un)folding measurements of several OMPs are characterized by accumulation of trapped intermediates in the folding or unfolding pathway, leading to hysteresis [7,8,16]. The characterization of such intermediates can provide useful information on the microscopic structure of the transition state, and the macroscopic mechanism of OMP assembly. Our current knowledge of OMP assembly has been obtained from extensive studies of E. coli proteins. Interestingly, however, recent studies show that membrane proteins exhibit species-specific variations in their folding mechanism [17-19]. It is therefore important to assess the assembly of atypical OMPs of other bacteria.\n\nThe formation of stable or transient (un)folding intermediates in OMPs is strongly regulated by specific residues in the polypeptide. For example, conserved aromatic residues (Phe, Tyr, Trp) located at the solvent-membrane interface act as lipid anchors during OMP assembly. Indeed, previous studies on various E. coli OMPs including OmpA [20], OmpX\n\n[21], PagP [13], OmpLA [22], FomA [23], and the human mitochondrial VDAC [24] highlight the importance of interface aromatics, particularly tryptophan, for β -barrel folding. Recent studies of these OMPs in lipidic vesicles have revealed interesting insights on unassisted OMP folding [12]. However, a detailed study of folding intermediates in vesicles is compounded by the accumulation of a heterogeneous population of partly folded states. In interesting contrast, detergent micelles conveniently alleviate this problem by stabilizing fewer long-lived intermediates while also retaining path-independent folding [14,16]. For example, phosphocholine (PC) micelles, which possess a similar zwitterionic nature as diacyl PC lipids, promote β -barrel folding without aggregation, are suitable for structural studies, and facilitate the mapping membrane protein folding intermediates [1,9].\n\nIn this study, we investigate the thermodynamic and kinetic factors contributing to the folding and stability of an atypical OMP from the category A pathogen Yersinia pestis. The attachment invasion locus (Ail) protein is an 8-stranded OMP vital for Y. pestis serum resistance, adhesion to and internalization into host cells, Yersinia outer proteins (Yop) delivery, and inhibition of host inflammatory response [25,26]. The study of Ail is therefore of interest as a potent drug target against this category A bioterrorism agent. Ail possess two interface tryptophans, W 42  and W 149  (of a total ~17% aromatic residues (2 Trp, 12 Tyr, and 12 Phe) in its polypeptide sequence of 157 amino acids) (Fig. 1A), which are important for Ail folding in detergent micelles [25]. Using fluorescence analysis of single tryptophan mutants, we show that Ail exhibits complex (un)folding kinetics, with a rapid assembly phase followed by slow rearrangement kinetics in PC micelles. A similar complex folding pathway is known so far only for E. coli OmpA [16]. An unexpected observation in our study is the disruption of Ail thermodynamic equilibrium upon mutation of W 42 . The AilPC system now shifts to kinetic control, leading to an apparent hysteresis. This hysteresis is accompanied by the formation of a hyperfluorescent intermediate that represents a lipid-solvated partially unfolded barrel. We find that the anchoring and stabilizing roles of W 42  and W 149  together play distinct roles in deciding the folding landscape of Ail, thereby offering interesting insight on novel intermediates in the OMP folding and unfolding pathways. Our findings with Ail will also serve as an excellent starting point to study the complex assembly and unfolding pathways of OMPs from other pathogens.\n\n## 2 Materials and methods\n\n## 2.1 Protein preparation and folding\n\nAll the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. LLC., and DPC (n-dodecyl phosphocholine) from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster. The ail gene (without signal sequence) was cloned into a pET3a vector, and all the single Trp mutants W 42 → F\/Y\/A and W 149 → F\/Y\/A were generated using site directed mutagenesis. All the proteins were expressed as inclusion bodies in E. coli C41 cells, and purified using reported protocols [25,26]. Independent protein preparations were used to set up each replicate experiment.\n\nFolding efficiency of Ail was screened in increasing concentrations of DPC (5 mM - 50 mM) from the unfolded Ail stock prepared in 8.0 m GdnHCl (guanidine hydrochloride) (data not shown). Above 10 mM DPC, complete folding of Ail was obtained without any detectable aggregation; thus, we selected 20 mM DPC concentration for further experiments.\n\nThe micelle integrity in 6.4 m GdnHCl (highest concentration used in our experiments) was checked independently using SYPRO® orange (discussed later in Fig. S2), as described previously [25].\n\nFolding of Ail was achieved by rapid 10-fold dilution of the unfolded protein (~1400 µM Ail in 8.0 m GdnHCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5), into the folding reaction containing 100 mM DPC prepared in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, followed by incubation for 5 h at 25 °C. Trace amounts of aggregated protein (if any) was removed by high-speed centrifugation at 18,000 xg at 10 °C. This folded 5× stock was diluted 5-fold in all the experiments, to achieve a final protein and DPC concentration of 28 µM and 20 mM, respectively (detergent-to-protein ratio of ~700:1) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 containing 160 mM GdnHCl. Protein concentration was quantified using A  280 , with different extinction coefficients for the WT and Trp mutants (28,880 M -1  cm -1  for Ail WT; 23,380 M -1  cm -1  for W42F, W149F, W42A, and W149A; 24,870 M -1  cm -1  for W42Y and W149Y at 280 nm).\n\n## 2.2 Assessment of folded Ail using mobility shift, far-UV CD, and NMR spectroscopy\n\nUpon folding, Ail exhibits different electrophoretic mobility compared to the unfolded protein, on cold SDS-PAGE gels. All the folded protein samples and samples before and after each experiment were checked for sample integrity and folding efficiency on 15% SDS-PAGE gels using the electrophoretic mobility assay [25].\n\nThe secondary structure content of WT Ail and all the folded Trp variants was checked using far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism (CD). All the CD measurements were carried out on a J-815 CD spectropolarimeter (JASCO Inc.) equipped with a water-cooled peltier 6-cell system, at 25 °C. For all the CD measurements, we used 28 µM folded protein in 20 mM DPC and 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, as described above. We recorded the far-UV CD spectra for Ail-WT and all the Trp mutants from 205 to 260 nm at a constant scan speed of 100 nm\/min, data integration time of 1 s, and data pitch of 0.5 nm. The data were averaged over three accumulations, and corrected for contributions from buffer and DPC micelles. The raw ellipticity value at 215 nm was then converted to molar ellipticity (ME  215 ). All the samples were checked on cold SDS-PAGE gels before and after the experiment.\n\nThe folded 5× stocks of uniformly  15 N-labeled WT, W42F, and W149F were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris buffer using stepwise dialysis to remove trace amounts of GdnHCl, as described previously [25]. HSQC-TROSY experiments were recorded at 45 °C on a 700 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe, as we were not able to observe well-dispersed HSQC-TROSY spectra of Ail at 25 °C due to sample viscosity (discussed in the results section). The final protein concentration of ~140 µM Ail in 100 mM DPC, corresponding to a DPR of ~700:1 was used for NMR measurements. The NMR samples were checked on 15% SDS-PAGE before recording HSQC-TROSY experiments. The data were processed and plotted using reported methods [27].\n\n## 2.3 (Un)folding kinetics measurements and chevron analysis\n\nThe (un)folding kinetics measurements were carried out using the RX2000 rapid mixing accessory (Applied Photophysics Ltd.) that was coupled to a FluoroMax 4 fluorimeter (Horiba Jobin Yvon Ltd.), with a dead time of ~8 ms. The kinetics measurements were\n\ncarried out at 25 °C by monitoring changes in Trp fluorescence, using λ ex = 295 nm and λ em-max  = 340 nm. For folding kinetics, the 5× unfolded protein stock (140 µM unfolded Ail in 5.0 m GdnHCl, and 20 mM Tris pH 8.5), was diluted 5-fold in 25 mM DPC containing varying concentrations of GdnHCl. Similarly, unfolding kinetics was measured by rapid dilution of the 5× folded protein stock (140 µM folded Ail in 100 mM DPC and 800 mM GdnHCl, in 20 mM Tris pH 8.5) into varying concentration of GdnHCl, and change in the fluorescence intensity at 340 nm was monitored. The DPR of ~700:1 was maintained throughout the kinetics measurements. The change in Trp fluorescence was monitored till the reaction attained saturation and no further change in fluorescence intensity was observed. The kinetic traces were recorded for &gt; 40 GdnHCl concentrations. All the kinetic measurements were carried out three times from the same stock sample. Each trace was fitted individually and the mean data obtained at each [GdnHCl] was used for the chevron analysis. In addition, at least 30 data points (~14 from folding kinetics and ~17 from unfolding kinetics measurements) were used for the chevron analysis of each protein to obtained reliable data.\n\nThe initial folding of Ail was completed within the dead time of the experiment. We fitted the slow rates of folding and unfolding for the final analyses (the fast rates were not measured due to experimental limitations). The data obtained from (un)folding measurements were processed as described previously [24]. Briefly, the kinetic traces were fitted to a single exponential function, and the rates k  (folding rate) and k f u (unfolding rate) were obtained at various GdnHCl concentrations. Here, the initial ~50-100 s of the folding kinetic traces, and ~10-20 s of the unfolding kinetics traces were not used in the fitting (discussed later in Fig. S6). The chevron plots thus obtained from these rates were then fitted globally to a two-state equation [12] with a shared m  f  and m  u (constants that represent the change in the accessible surface for a protein on folding or unfolding, respectively), to derive \/u1D458 f 0 and \/u1D458 u 0 (folding and unfolding rates, respectively, in buffer), and the kinetic free energy Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 was calculated for all the proteins. A shared m value was used, as the mutation of a single residue does not affect the overall change in accessible surface area of the protein (supported by the far-UV CD profiles). We obtain the standard deviation for Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 from propagation of uncertainty (propagation of error) obtained from \/u1D458 f 0 and \/u1D458 u 0 , as mentioned below [28]:\n\n<!-- formula-not-decoded -->\n\nhere, \/u1D6FF Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 = error for Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 ; \/u1D6FF\/u1D458 f 0 = error for r\/u1D458 f 0 ; and \/u1D6FF\/u1D458 u 0 = error for \/u1D458 u 0 .\n\n## 3 Equilibrium (un)folding titrations\n\nThe equilibrium (un)folding experiments were carried out as described earlier with minor modifications [25]. The unfolded protein stock (140 µM Ail in 100 mM DPC and 5.0 m GdnHCl, in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5) and the folded protein stock (140 µM Ail in 100 mM DPC and 800 mM GdnHCl, in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5) were diluted 5-fold into a\n\nGdnHCl gradient, and a DPR of 700:1 was maintained throughout the experiments. The lowest GdnHCl concentration that can be achieved in the folding equilibrium is 1.0 M, while the lowest GdnHCl concentration for the unfolding equilibrium is 0.16 M. Therefore, the GdnHCl range for folding and unfolding titrations is from 1.0 M-5.0 m and 0.16 M-6.0 M, respectively. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C, and Trp fluorescence emission spectra were acquired between 320 and 380 nm, using a λ ex = 295 nm. Equilibrium was achieved within 24 h, and the 48 h data was used for analysis. For all the equilibrium measurements, 33 data points (for both folding and unfolding equilibrium) were acquired from at least 3 independent datasets obtained from independent folding and unfolding stocks prepared from at least 3 independent purified protein preparations. The fraction unfolded (f U  ) at λ em-max of 336 nm and the average wavelength (&lt; λ &gt;) values were plotted against the respective GdnHCl concentrations, as described previously [25]. The average wavelength data for folding and unfolding equilibrium of all the proteins were fitted globally to a two-state unfolding model with a shared m, as described previously [12]. We obtain a common m of -3.21 kcal mol -1  M -1  for all the proteins, except for the folding equilibrium data of W42X mutants, where the m value is different (-2.52 kcal mol -1  M -1 ). The calculated m values were used to derive the midpoint of the chemical denaturation (C  m ), and absolute or apparent folding and unfolding free energy values (∆G  0,F  or Δ \/u1D43A app 0, F , and ∆G  0,U or Δ \/u1D43A app 0, U , respectively). Anisotropy (r) values of all postequilibrium (48 h) samples were recorded at 25 °C, as described previously [25]. The anisotropy values obtained for each sample was plotted against the respective GdnHCl concentrations, and the data were fitted to a sigmoidal function to derive the C  m . C m-start is the intercept of the linear extrapolations of the pre-transition baseline and transition zone in the equilibrium profiles (see [29] for similar calculations from thermal measurements).\n\n## 4 Acrylamide quenching and lifetime measurements\n\nWe studied the local environment of both tryptophans using its intrinsic fluorescence as the reporter. Post-equilibrium samples (48 h) were incubated with increasing concentrations of acrylamide (0.0-0.5 M) for 15 min, and Trp fluorescence ( λ ex = 295 nm and λ em-max = 336 nm) was recorded. The λ em-max  for the sample without acrylamide was used for normalization, and the data obtained were fitted to a polynomial function. The slope of the polynomial fit corresponded to the Stern-Volmer quenching constant (K  SV ) [25]. Average Trp lifetime (&lt; τ &gt;) was measured for all the samples on a DeltaFlex TCSPC system (Horiba Jobin Yvon Ltd.), as described earlier [25]. Briefly, samples with and without acrylamide were excited at 292 nm, and Trp lifetime was recorded at the λ em-max  for all the samples (336 nm for the folded, 340 nm for partially unfolded, 354 nm for partially folded and unfolded samples). Decay curves were fitted to a three exponential decay function to derive the &lt; τ &gt;. The χ 2  values were maintained at &lt; 1.2. The bimolecular quenching rate constant (k q ) and apparent rotational correlation time ( τ c ) were derived using the formulae k  q  = K SV\/&lt; τ &gt; and τ c =&lt; τ &gt; r\/(r 0 -r) [5]. Here, r 0  = 0.3, and represents the anisotropy of free indole [5]. In all measurements, samples folded in DPC (containing 0.16 m GdnHCl), and protein in 8.0 m GdnHCl without DPC, served as the folded and unfolded controls, respectively.\n\n## 4.1 Co-evolutionary analysis of W 42  and W 149\n\nCo-evolution analysis of the two intrinsic Trp residues of Ail was done using EVfold (http:\/\/ evfold.org\/) [30]. Here, we first generated the multiple sequence alignment of various OMPs using Pfam (pfam.sanger.ac.uk) database. The EVfold server (http:\/\/evfold.org\/) [30] was then used to perform the co-evolution analysis to find the conservation pattern for W 42  and W 149 . For the EVFold analysis, Ail sequences from Y. pestis, and the crystal structure of Ail (PDB ID: 3QRA) was used as template. Coevolving residues are presented as a network, for comparison.\n\n## 5 Results\n\n## 5.1 Folding analysis of Ail and its mutants in zwitterionic DPC micelles\n\nAil possesses two tryptophans at positions 42 and 149. Here, W 149  is highly conserved across most OMPs, whereas W 42  is less conserved (while Trp is more abundant, Leu and Phe are also observed) (Fig. S1). Both Trp residues of Ail are located at the membranewater interface (Fig. 1A). To address the role of Trp in particular and aromaticity in general on Ail folding, we systematically substituted each Trp to Phe, Tyr, or Ala (Fig. 1B). In the first set of experiments, we folded Ail and its interface Trp mutants in the zwitterionic 12-C detergent n-dodecyl phosphocholine (DPC) micelles. The detergent-to-protein ratio (DPR) is critical for Ail folding and stability [25]. Ail remains largely monomeric and well-folded in DPC concentrations &gt; 10 mM (data not shown). On the basis of the screening results, we selected 28 µM Ail and 20 mM DPC (DPR of ~700:1), in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5, and a temperature of 25 °C, for our experiments. As urea does not fully unfold Ail [25], for our thermodynamic measurements, we used guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) as the denaturant. To ensure that Ail unfolding was not due to the dissociation of DPC micelles, we checked for micelle integrity in the presence of up to 6.4 m GdnHCl, using the fluorescence of SYPRO ®  orange dye (CMC of DPC in buffer is ~1.25 mM, whereas the CMC increases to ~12.5 mM in 6.4 m GdnHCl) (Fig. S2). Therefore, we carried out all our studies in 20 mM DPC, which is at least 2-fold higher than the CMC of DPC in the highest [GdnHCl] used in this study. This ensured that the energetics we measure here stems primarily from the biophysical properties of the protein.\n\nIn DPC micelles, folded Ail has markedly different biophysical properties from the unfolded protein. For example, in cold SDS-PAGE gels, Ail exhibits a prominent electrophoretic migration upon folding (Fig. S3). Folded Ail is resistant to proteolysis (data not shown). The secondary structure content of Ail assessed using far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectrometry shows prominent negative ellipticity centered at 215 nm, characteristic of a β -sheet rich structure (Fig. 1C). A similar β -sheet content seen for all the Trp mutants confirms that the mutation does not affect the overall scaffold of Ail. A blue-shifted fluorescence emission spectrum with maximum emission intensity ( λ em-max ) at 336 nm is also seen for Ail WT and the mutants upon folding in DPC micelles (see Fig. S4). HSQC-TROSY spectra of uniformly  15 N-la-beled Ail show well-dispersed resonances that superpose well for Ail WT and its Trp mutants (Fig. 2). Overall, these results confirm that under in vitro folding conditions, all the mutants fold to a similar extent, and Trp substitution does not impede the ability of Ail to form a well-folded barrel.\n\nInterestingly, the single Trp mutants (W42X and W149X) show distinctly different fluorescence intensities at 336 nm (Fig. 1D). This change in the spectral property suggests that W 42  and W 149  reside in different local environments. The latter is further evident in HSQC-TROSY measurements of Ail WT and its mutants (Fig. 2). Here, a more downfield shifted W 42  amide resonance indicates that this indole resides in a more polar environment than W 149 . Our conclusion is also confirmed by anisotropy (r) measurements, with r ≈ 0.155 ± 0.004 for W 42  (W149X mutants) and r ≈ 0.126 ± 0.008 for W 149  (W42X mutants) (see Table S1 for a comparison of r values), showing a difference of ~0.029. Differences in anisotropy between two distinct states of a membrane protein are small (Table S1), and such differences are indeed significant. The results from fluorescence, NMR, and anisotropy together reveal that W 42  resides in a more polar and rigid environment, whereas W 149 is present in a comparatively more apolar and dynamic environment. Next, we carried out kinetics and equilibrium measurements in DPC micelles using Trp as the reporter to understand the biophysical characteristics that influence folding-unfolding pathways of Ail.\n\n## 5.2 Ail core assembles independent of interface residues\n\nTo understand the early events in Ail (un)folding, we used the two interface tryptophans as reporters of β -barrel assembly. The two Trp residues in Ail are located at opposite faces of the barrel, and reside in dissimilar local environments, as discussed above. This provides a unique advantage to monitor distinct changes in Ail during barrel folding. We measured the conformational changes of DPC-folded Ail, spectroscopically using increasing concentrations of GdnHCl as the denaturant. Representative folding and unfolding kinetics of Ail WT are presented in Fig. 3A (see Fig. S5 for the magnified traces). The process is accompanied by a rapid change in the fluorescence intensity in both the folding and unfolding kinetics that occurs within the dead time of detection. Ail folding is, therefore, faster than other bacterial OMPs such as PagP [12], OmpX [21], and OmpA [16]. This 'burst phase' intensity varies proportionately with increase in the denaturant concentration, and indicates the accumulation of an early intermediate in the (un) folding of Ail (see Fig. S5 for magnified traces highlighting the initial burst phase and lag phase). Although we could not capture this early intermediate, the kinetic traces are comparable for the mutants, allowing us to conclude that the early events in Ail (un)folding are Trp-independent and do not involve detectable changes in the local environment of both the indoles.\n\nAil (un)folding kinetics shows the presence of at least two phases, where the rapid (un)folding event (in seconds) is followed by slow (un) folding transition that occurs over minutes (Fig. 3A). Here, the folding kinetics traces show three transitions: an early decay phase, followed by a fast folding phase and a slow folding phase (Fig. S6A). We fi tted all the transitions individually to single exponential functions to derive folding rates (k d1 , k  f1 , and k f2 ) (Fig. S6A). Interestingly, only the amplitude A  f2  associated with the rate k  f2 shows a significant dependence on the GdnHCl concentration, indicating that only k f2 contributes significantly to the folding process that we are monitoring. Therefore, we used only the slowest rate for our analysis (Fig. S6A). Similarly, the unfolding kinetics traces can be fitted to both single as well as double exponential functions. As seen with the folding kinetics, the slow rate of unfolding (k  u ) and the associated amplitude (A  u ) obtained from a single exponential function was sufficient to explain the unfolding profiles (Fig. S6B).\n\nOverall, Ail shows complex folding and unfolding profiles comprising of multiple transitions (Fig. S6C). Such complex folding kinetics is well-known for transmembrane β -barrels in membranes [10,14], but is rare in micelles and has been reported so far only for E. coli OmpA [16]. As the folding and unfolding amplitudes for the fast rates (A  d1 and A  u1 ) show no denaturant dependence (see Fig. S6), we analyzed only the slow rates of (un)folding (see Fig. S6 for details). Chevron plots generated from the slow rates (k  f2  and k u ) show linear folding and unfolding arms with no rollover for Ail WT and all the mutants (Fig. 3B, S6C). The data were fitted to a two-state model to derive the folding and unfolding rate constants, change in accessible surface area, and the stability. Comparison of the change in free energy ( Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 ) reveals that the (un)folding kinetics of Ail is not significantly affected by mutating the interface Trp residues. For example, Ail WT shows a Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 of ~7.9 kcal mol -1 , which is similar across the Trp mutants. A marginal destabilization of ~0.5 kcal mol -1  is seen only for W149F (Fig. 3C, Table S2). Overall, we observe that Trp substitution does not significantly affect the Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 of Ail.\n\nNext, we calculated the Tanford β ( β T) value, which is a measure of the compactness of the transition state. In other words, β T measures the average degree of exposure of the protein in the transition state compared to the native or unfolded states [31]. High β T values (up to ~0.95), indicates that the protein shows native-like compaction in the transition state. We obtain similar β T values of ~0.20 for all the mutants (Table S2), which suggests that in the transition state, the environment of both tryptophans resembles the unfolded state. The values obtained for Ail are higher than bacteriorhodopsin ( β T = 0.13-0.14) [32], but marginally lower than the rhomboid protease GlpG ( β T = 0.23 ± 0.02) [33]. β T values for bacteriorhodopsin and GlpG (unfolded using SDS) are underestimated, because the denatured state of helical proteins in SDS is more compact due to incomplete unfolding. On the other hand, the β T of Ail is lower than other transmembrane β -barrel proteins; e.g., β T is ~0.48 for human mitochondrial VDAC2 porin in GdnHCl [24], ~0.23 and ~0.29 for OmpA in urea and GdnHCl, respectively (here, β T was calculated only using m  f  and m  u ) [16]. Hence, the transition state structure of Ail is less compact than other β -barrels.\n\nOverall, we find that Ail folding in DPC micelles occurs through the formation of an early intermediate that subsequently undergoes slow rearrangement over several seconds-minutes to form the folded barrel. Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 and β T values together support our conclusion that neither interface tryptophan contributes significantly to the early intermediates formed in the folding and unfolding processes. In other words, mutations of the two interface indoles bear little impact on Ail (un)folding kinetics. A similar folding mechanism is also observed in E. coli OmpA in vesicles [16], suggesting that the process of OMP folding in micelles and vesicles could indeed be similar. Further investigation of the transition state is presently underway to obtain a better understanding of Ail assembly.\n\n## 5.3 Substitution of W 42  shifts the thermodynamic equilibrium towards kinetic control\n\nAil exhibits path-independent reversible folding and attains thermodynamic equilibrium in DPC micelles in ~24 h (Fig. 4A, middle panel; and S8). Here, the folded protein shows a λ em-max ≈ 336 nm, which shows a red shift to λ em-max ≈ 360 nm upon barrel unfolding in\n\nhigh GdnHCl concentrations (Fig. S9). We fitted the data to a two-state model with a shared m of ± 3.21 kcal mol -1  M -1  to obtain the thermodynamic parameters listed in Table 1 (also see Fig. 4, Table S3). The W42X mutants showed poorer folding cooperativity and an m = -2.52 kcal mol  -1  m  -1 was used. The WT protein shows no hysteresis and we obtain a change in the equilibrium free energy derived from the unfolding transition (∆G 0, U ) of ~8.0 kcal mol -1 , which is similar to the Δ \/u1D43A kin 0 (see Fig. 3C).\n\nSimilar to WT, the W 149 → F\/Y\/A mutants also show no hysteresis. Interestingly, Trp substitution lowers the thermodynamic stability of Ail (Table 1). Mutating W 149  to the other aromatic residues destabilizes Ail marginally (Fig. 4, and S8; Table 1 and S3). The extent of destabilization is highest in the Ala mutant, where there is a considerable decrease in free energy by ~1.7 kcal mol -1 . Further, the lowered C  m  of W149A mutant suggests that at the 149th position, a preference is seen for aromatic side chains (Fig. 4B, Table 1 and S3), which is in line with the lipid-solvated environment for this indole. Our results show that W 149  helps in stabilizing the folded Ail barrel, and in resisting protein solvation by GdnHCl. Beyond a critical concentration of GdnHCl, native contacts are rapidly replaced by protein-GdnHCl interactions, and both Ail WT and W149X show cooperative unfolding (note the similar m eq value in Fig. 4, Table 1 and S3).\n\nIn interesting contrast to the W149X mutants, the substitution of W 42  (to F\/Y\/A) results in prominent hysteresis (Fig. 4A, left panel, and S8), and the stability of the mutant appears to now be under kinetic control. It must be noted here that in the W42X mutants, we monitor the fluorescence properties of W 149 . From the folding titration for the W 42 → F\/Y\/A mutants, we obtain Δ \/u1D43A app 0, F values that are lower than Ail WT by ~2.3-3.5 kcal mol -1 , with the W42A mutant showing the highest destabilization (see Table S3). As with the W149A mutant, the substitution of W 42  to Ala is more deleterious than Tyr and Phe. In all three W42X mutants, barrel formation is completed only when the GdnHCl concentration is lowered considerably and after prolonged incubation at 25 °C (for &gt; 5 h, see Methods for details; complete folding is demonstrated in Fig. 1C, 2, S3 and S4). Comparison of the Δ \/u1D43A app 0, F obtained from the folding titrations suggests that W 42  is more important than W 149  for Ail stability. The absence of hysteresis in Ail WT and W149X mutants suggests that substitution of W 42  gives rise to the observed hysteresis in the unfolding titrations, and that W 42  is required for path-independent (un)folding of Ail.\n\nUnlike the W149X mutants, all the folded W 42 → F\/Y\/A mutants resist GdnHCl-mediated unfolding, and exhibit a substantial increase in thermodynamic parameters (Table 1 and S3). For instance, the ∆G app, W42 → A  0, U is &gt; 1.0 kcal mol -1 higher than Ail WT (Fig. 4B, Table 1 and S3). To verify our observation, we monitored changes in fluorophore rigidity during barrel (un)folding by measuring Trp fluorescence anisotropy (r). In line with equilibrium measurements, the anisotropy (r) measurements also indicate that WT and W149X mutants show no hysteresis (Fig. S8 and S10). In contrast, the W42X mutants show hysteresis and a concomitant increase in the C  m  of unfolding (Fig. S8 and S10). The observed hysteresis is consistent in our &lt; λ &gt;, f U, and r measurements, which validates our inference that W 42 maintains the path-independent folding of Ail and keeps the barrel under thermodynamic equilibrium, and mutation of W 42  switches the unfolding pathway to kinetic control. Further,\n\nwe also observe poor(er) folding efficiency of the W42X mutants and an associated lowering of the folding free energy. Previously, we have also shown an important role of W 42  during Ail folding in LDAO micelles [25]. Putting together the rigid nature of W 42 , its position at the lipid interface, and the change in free energies (Tables S1, S2, and S3; Figs. 1, 3, and 4), we propose that W 42  contributes to Ail barrel rearrangement by the likely formation of optimal anchoring interactions with the lipidic milieu.\n\nTo obtain molecular insight on how the local Trp environment influences our observation, we carried out a co-evolution analysis to map the interaction network of each indole. W 42 shows the presence of three aromatic residues (F 28 , F 80 , Y 36 ) and several polar entities (E 37 , N 39 , D 40 , D 41 , R 81 ) in its 5 Å vicinity (Fig. S11). Abundance of polar residues in the vicinity of an aromatic residue such as W 42  suggests a lipidanchoring role for the Trp, Phe, and Tyr residues at the periplasmic face of the barrel. On the other hand, W 149  is surrounded largely by aromatic (Y 11 , Y 136 ) and hydrophobic residues (A 12 , M 150 , L 151 ); polar entities (S 14 , Q 147 , T 148 ) are less abundant than the vicinity of W 42 , and charged residues are absent (Fig. S11), indicating that W 149  is more lipid solvated than W 42 . Based on the structure of Ail, W 149  is likely to establish T-shaped aromatic interactions with Y 11  and Y 136 . Such Trp-Tyr interactions are energetically favorable, and can contribute up to 1.0 kcal mol -1 per interaction [20,27]. Interestingly, W 42  coevolves with the three hydrophobic and apolar residues P 78 , F 80 , and L 88 , whereas W 149  shows direct co-evolution with A 134 , S 135 , and Y 136  (Fig. S12 and Table S5). Both tryptophans form a strong evolutionary interaction network with both polar and apolar residues (Fig. S12 and Table S5), with W 149  being more conserved and forming a larger molecular interactome than W 42 . Hence, the evolutionary selection of W 42  in Ail is a direct consequence of the role of this indole in Ail assembly and scaffold stability.\n\nOverall, our results allow us to reach the following conclusions: (i) at the interface, the thermodynamic preference for residues 42 and 149 follows the order W &gt; Y ≈ F &gt; A; (ii) the mutation of W 42  lowers Ail folding efficiency; thereby, W 42  is more important than W 149  for Ail folding, (iii) W 42  maintains the path-independent folding of Ail and retains the Ail barrel under thermodynamic equilibrium; (iv) once folded, W42X mutants show resistance to chemical denaturation, giving rise to the apparent hysteresis; (v) due to the apparent hysteresis, stability of folded Ail follows the order W42X &gt; WT &gt; W149X, where X = F\/Y\/A. Overall, we find that W 42  is required for Ail folding, while W 149 contributes considerably to the stability of the folded Ail barrel. Additionally, we conclude that the observed hysteresis in Ail is driven primarily by the substitution of W 42 . In other words, W 42  contributes to the activation energy barrier for Ail (un)folding. A recent study identified the role of negative charges in the occurrence of hysteresis in the E. coli β -barrel OmpLA [34]. Our results with Ail add to this finding by showing the importance of interfacial tryptophans for thermodynamic equilibrium and path-independent (un)folding of outer membrane proteins. The observed hysteresis upon substitution of W 42  might arise from several factors (e.g., the formation of non-native contacts in the folded Ail W42X barrel, the population of unique unfolding intermediate(s), etc.). To further understand the unique molecular features of W 149  (W42X mutants), we carried out detailed spectroscopic measurements to check the local environments of both tryptophans.\n\n## 5.4 Hyperfluorescent intermediate in the Ail unfolding pathway reveals the likely formation of a molten globule\n\nThe significant contribution of Trp residues to folding and stability of Ail directed us to investigate the local environment of W 42  and W 149 . Typically, an equilibrium unfolding profile shows transition of protein from the folded state (RF) to the unfolded state (UF). Here, Ail transitions cooperatively from the unfolded to the folded state between 2.0 M-4.0 m GdnHCl. We have categorized the [GdnHCl] at the start and end of this cooperative transition as partially unfolded (PAR-UF*) and partially folded (PAR-RF) conformations, respectively. We reasoned that at these intermediate [GdnHCl], the protein conformation resembles neither the fully folded nor the fully unfolded states of Ail. The schematic shown in Fig. 6 illustrates the folded (RF), partially unfolded (PAR-UF*), partially folded (PARRF), and unfolded (UF) states of the protein (we use this nomenclature merely to simplify our explanation of the complex protein folding process). The fluorescence properties of each state changes on the basis of extent of unfolding and solvent accessibility of the tryptophans.\n\nWhen exposed to a chemical denaturant such as GdnHCl, Ail shows unfolding as well as a proportional decrease in the fluorescence intensity (Fig. S9). By and large, folded Ail WT and the W149X mutants exhibit the anticipated decrease in Trp emission in the order RF → PAR-UF* → PAR-RF → UF (Fig. 5, middle and right panels). However, the W42X mutants show ~20% increase in the fluorescence intensity of the PAR-UF* state compared to RF state (Fig. 5A; left panel, 5B; right panel and S6B). The increase in fluorescence intensity of the W42X mutants in the PAR-UF* state suggests that at this intermediate concentration of ~2.4 m GdnHCl, W 149  experiences a change in its local environment where it occludes GdnHCl. In other words, the vicinity of W 149  transitions to a buried (lipidsolvated) hyperfluorescent state before barrel unfolding commences. Prolonged incubation of the W42X mutants in ~2.4 m GdnHCl does not alter the spectral properties, suggesting that this hyperfluorescent species is stable and under equilibrium. Absence of detectable hyperfluorescence during the unfolding of Ail WT and W149X suggests that formation of this species is modulated uniquely by W 149 .\n\nFar-UV CD, fluorescence, and HSQC measurements confirm that the folded state of the W42X mutants is nearly identical to Ail WT (see Fig. 1C, 2, and S4). We further characterized this hyperfluorescent intermediate using CD. We find a possible variation in the rigidity of W 42 and W 149 , and different local environments for the indole rings in the folded proteins (Fig. S13). Additionally, the hyperfluorescent species (PAR-UF* state at ~2.4 m GdnHCl) in the W42X mutants shows an increased β -sheet content (Fig. S14). This suggests a possible change in the DPC-Ail interaction when only W 149  is retained, giving rise to an observable hyperfluorescent intermediate.\n\nTo obtain better insight into the spectral characteristics of W 149 , we carried out an in-depth fluorescence analysis. First, we examined indole accessibility and quenching efficiency by measuring the Stern-Volmer constant (K  SV ) and bimolecular quenching constant (k  q ). In addition, we monitored indole rigidity using anisotropy (r), and the rotational correlation time ( τ c ), and compared the results with Trp lifetimes (&lt; τ &gt;). A typical unfolding pro fi le of Ail W42F is presented in Fig. 6A, indicating different species in the unfolding titration, as the protein transitions from RF to PAR-UF*, PAR-RF, and UF states. We compared various\n\nparameters for all the mutants from both the unfolding and the folding profiles (Fig. 6B-D, Table S4).\n\nAs anticipated, we observe an increase in K  SV  and k  q  for WT and the W149X mutants upon unfolding, while the corresponding r,&lt; τ &gt;, and τ c are lowered (Table S4). Remarkably, the partially unfolded hyper-fluorescent intermediate (PAR-UF* in Fig. 6 left panel) seen in the unfolding equilibrium for W42X mutants at ~2.4 m GdnHCl displays lowered K  SV , and k  q ; the corresponding values of r,&lt; τ &gt;, and τ c are anomalous and higher than WT in the mutants possessing only W 149  (Fig. 6B-D and S8, Table S4). The lowered accessibility of the W 149  fluorophore and the associated increase in W 149 lifetime values reaffirms our initial deduction that at GdnHCl concentrations ≈ 2.4 M, W 149 adopts a solvent-occluded lipid-solvated environment. This lipidsolvated state gives rise to the hyperfluorescence that we observe in the equilibrium titrations, and is coupled with an anomalous anisotropy value (also see Fig. S14 for changes in near-UV CD). Such a hyperfluorescent state is not the result of a spatially proximal quencher, as K  SV  and k  q would be unaffected by static quenchers [29]. Further, we observe negligible differences in the data of W42F\/Y\/A mutants, suggesting that the nature of the amino acid at the 42nd position has no impact on the formation of the hyperfluorescent intermediate. Overall, on the basis of K  SV , k  q , r, τ c , and &lt; τ &gt; measurements, we conclude that the removal of W 42 and retention of W 149  is necessary and sufficient for the formation of this hyperfluorescent species.\n\nThe change in spectral properties of W 149  may arise due to (i) stronger detergent-indole interaction in the PAR-UF* state, or (ii) change in the local environment of W 149  to a buried state. In other words, the buried and solvent excluded conformation of W 149  could either be due to micelle expansion, protein compaction, or an increase in the secondary structure of the barrel. Based on our observations, we postulate that the quencher-inaccessible state of W 149  could resemble a molten globule-like conformation formed during Ail unfolding. Further, this lipid-anchoring property of W 149  may be crucial to establish strong protein-lipid interactions that influence Ail unfolding. Interestingly, the hyperfluorescent intermediate is W 149 -dependent and occurs only in the W42X proteins, is absent in W149X wherein only W 42  is retained, and is masked in WT Ail wherein both the tryptophans are present (see Fig. S14, S15). Therefore, we reason that the hysteresis in Ail W42X mutants arises due to a change in detergent-protein interactions in these proteins, and the intrinsic hyperfluorescence of W 149  is the consequence of the lipid-solvated state of the W 149  indole. We also conclude that the change in spectroscopic properties of W 149  is effected despite conserved substitutions at W 42 .\n\nFinally, we conclude from our observations that Ail undergoes a conformational transition upon GdnHCl-mediated denaturation, and unfolds via a stable hyperfluorescent unfolding intermediate. Occurrence of this hyperfluorescent intermediate gives rise to the apparent hysteresis in the unfolding of Ail W42X mutants. The absence of detectable intermediate for WT and W149X suggests that the lipid anchoring properties of W 149  leads to a change in its fluorescence property by alterations in the detergent-protein interaction. The latter drives the local environment of W 149  to a solvent-occluded lipid solvated environment in the unfolding transition. Similar molten globule-like structures are rare for membrane proteins,\n\nand detailed characterization of their structure will help in understanding membrane protein folding, unfolding, and function.\n\n## 6 Discussion\n\nUnderstanding the mechanism of transmembrane β -barrel folding is important to deduce the significance of evolutionary selection of each unique polypeptide sequence in balancing protein structure, stability, and its function. Despite the several excellent reports on OMP folding, most of the studies use E. coli proteins (e.g., OmpA [10,11,20], OmpX [21.29], PagP [12], OmpLA [22], FomA [23]). Membrane proteins are known to exhibit speciesdependent variations in their folding mechanism [17-19]. Hence, we reasoned that it is important to study the assembly of atypical OMPs. Here, we study the folding, stability, and unfolding pathway of the attachment invasion locus (Ail) protein β -barrel from the category A pathogen Y. pestis. Our study on the role of interfacial tryptophans on the folding of Ail has revealed the unexpected finding that, unlike bacterial and mitochondrial (VDAC2 [24]) OMPs that require tryptophans to critically aid their folding [10.20.21.24.29], interface tryptophans are neither important for the initial process of Ail assembly nor the early events of Ail unfolding. Additionally, our kinetics measurements show that Ail employs a multistep folding and assembly pathway, known to exist primarily in OMP folding in bilayer membranes [10,14], but is rare for OMPs in micelles [16].\n\nOur study also reveals that specific interface tryptophans of Ail contribute to the final barrel rearrangement process, to the post-folding stability, and to the unfolding. In particular, W 42 is more important than W 149  for the late events in Ail folding and barrel rearrangement. W 149  is crucial for post-folding stability of the Ail scaffold, as it forms strong protein-lipid interactions. Such distinction imparts differential importance to each tryptophan in the Ail scaffold, and demarcates this barrel from its E. coli analog OmpX [21]. We find that W 42 is required for the path-independent folding and thermodynamic stability of Ail. This is evident from the hysteresis observed when W 42  is substituted and only W 149  is retained. While the evolutionarily conserved W 149  establishes a strong intra-protein hydrophobic interaction network and contributes to barrel stability, W 42  not only forms a weaker interaction network, but is also poorly conserved in other OMPs (see Fig. S1). Our study assigns a specific role for W 42  in Ail, as vital for Ail folding kinetics and stability. The additive effect of both tryptophans on Ail stability correlates well with the evolutionary requirement of Ail for thermodynamic equilibrium, and to maintain plasticity in its structure [35,36]. OmpX (the structural analog of Ail in E. coli) possesses unusually high stability compared to Ail, but is functionally inactive. Therefore, we are tempted to suggest that the evolutionary selection of W 42  in the Ail sequence for structural plasticity may additionally bear significance. Further studies in this direction are, however, needed.\n\nInterestingly, hysteresis is unique only to the W 42  mutants, indicating that the pathdependence of the unfolding event (and the associated apparent free energy values ( Δ \/u1D43A app 0, \/u1D448 ) is imposed by the mutation (see Fig. 4A), and is not a consequence of the folding conditions. The occurrence of hysteresis in Ail unfolding provides a unique opportunity to map the hyperfluorescent state and to study the folding and unfolding pathways of Ail independently. Based on the results, we propose a plausible model both\n\nfor Ail assembly and Ail unfolding. Here, the folding of Ail can be divided into (i) early folding phase that occurs within seconds, and (ii) final barrel rearrangement that occurs over several minutes-hours. The initial folding phase is Trp-independent and does not involve changes in the local environment of the two interface indoles. While the multi-step folding and unfolding kinetics we see for Ail, is reported thus far only for OmpA [16], our results are also in good agreement with the overall assembly mechanisms proposed for OMPs [8,10,16,37]. The anchoring property attributed to the indole side chain is relevant only after the initial barrel assembly is completed. The rearrangement process is now Trp-dependent and is mediated by the interplay of W 42  and W 149  (Fig. 7).\n\nNotably, the folding process in vivo requires the barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex, which acts as the chaperone. On the other hand, OMP unfolding is BAMindependent. Our observation of the novel hyperfluorescent intermediate provides the first experimental data that differentiates the unfolding process from folding. Thermodynamic studies of OMP folding are preferably carried out in conditions that facilitate path independence. Hence, molecular factors that selectively drive OMP unfolding are usually considered in similar lines as the folding events. The occurrence of hysteresis as a consequence of this hyperfluorescent intermediate in Ail provides us with the first unique opportunity to study the molecular steps involved in the unfolding of an OMP. We find that Ail unfolding is nucleated in the vicinity of W 42 , and progresses towards W 149  (the post-folding anchor). The anchoring ability of W 149  resist barrel unfolding and gives rise to the hyperfluorescent species before unfolding is complete. Hyperfluorescence is usually the signature of a folding intermediate that is thermodynamically stabilized [38]. A similar molten globule-like flexible state has been observed for ankyrin-repeat protein, ubiquitin, and yeast phosphoglycerate kinase [38-40], but has not yet been reported for any OMP.\n\nThe occurrence of hyperfluorescence in the unfolding pathway in vivo and the significance of this state is yet to be established. The latter will require novel sophisticated methods for direct detection of OMP folding in the Yersinia outer membrane. Nonetheless, we speculate based on our current observations, that W 42  and W 149  are likely to play vital roles in the folding and anchoring, respectively, of Ail in the Yersinia outer membrane. A recent report on the folding pathway of the OmpA barrel in varying lipidic conditions highlights the relevance of results obtained from in vitro studies to the mechanism by which OMP assembly takes place in the cell [8,37]. Similar studies with other atypical OMPs can lead to the identification of other molten-globule like intermediate states, and provide novel insights into the unfolding pathway of kinetically stabilized OMPs. Our findings on Ail will serve as an excellent starting point to further understand the parallel (complex) folding and unfolding mechanisms of other biologically important OMPs from pathogenic bacteria, and mitochondria.\n\n## Supplementary Material\n\nRefer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nA.G. thanks IISER Bhopal for research fellowship.

A naturally occurring single-nucleotide polymorphism ( NQO1*2 ) in the NQO1 gene leads to an amino acid substitution (P187S), which severely compromises the activity and stability of the enzyme. The NQO1*2 genotype has been linked to a higher risk for several types of cancer and poor survival rate after anthracycline-based chemotherapy. In this study, we show that a small molecular chaperone (N-(2-bromophenyl)pyrrolidine-1-sulfonamide) repopulates the native wild-type conformation. As a consequence of the stabilizing effect, the enzymatic activity of the P187S variant protein is strongly improved in the presence of the molecular chaperone in vitro .\n\nKeywords: cancer; chemical chaperone; chemotherapeutics; quinone; single-nucleotide polymorphism\n\nNAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1; EC 1.6. 99.2) is a human FAD-dependent enzyme catalyzing the two-electron reduction of quinones to hydroquinones. NQO1, for instance, plays an important role in the antioxidant defense system where it lowers the quinone levels and thereby prevents the formation of reactive oxygen species [1,2]. Furthermore, it binds to the 20 S proteasome, thus rescuing several tumor suppressors like p33 ING1b , p53, and p73 from proteasomal degradation [2,3]. Due to the broad substrate scope,\n\nNQO1 can activate chemotherapeutic prodrugs, such as mitomycin C and b -lapachone, and since the level of NQO1 is increased in several tumors, the quinonebased chemotherapeutic activity will be specifically observed on the tumor cells [4-6].\n\nA naturally occurring single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) ( NQO1*2 ) in the NQO1 gene (C609T, on chromosome 16q22.1) results in the replacement of proline 187 with serine (P187S) in the amino acid sequence [7]. The distribution of the homozygous\n\n## Abbreviations\n\nBPPSA, N-(2-bromophenyl)pyrrolidine-1-sulfonamide; HDX-MS, hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1; PDB, protein data bank; SAXS, small-angle X-ray scattering; SNP, single-nucleotide polymorphism; WT, wild-type.\n\nNQO1*2 in the human population varies between 2% and 20% depending on the ethnic background and is most common in Asian, Mexican Hispanic, and Native American populations [8,9]. The NQO1*2 genotype is associated with an increased toxicity of benzene and higher risk for several types of cancers including lung, colon, breast, and leukemia [10-12]. Additionally, an adverse breast cancer outcome has been reported after anthracycline-based chemotherapy, with a survival rate of 17% for patients with the NQO1*2 genotype compared to 75% for other genotypes [11].\n\nIn a previous study, we have demonstrated that the NQO1 P187S variant is unstable in solution, although its crystallographic structure is virtually identical to the wild-type protein [13]. This instability is apparently caused by proline to serine substitution, which weakens the interaction between the core and C-terminal domain of the P187S variant protein. It was also shown that the cofactor affinity and thereby also the activity are affected in the P187S variant protein as a consequence of the structural instability [13]. This observation led to the idea that binding of a small molecule may reduce the conformational flexibility of the protein and thereby may exert a beneficial effect on the stability and activity of the P187S variant protein. A similar approach has already been described by Medina-Carmona et al ., where the strong competitive inhibitor dicoumarol, first described by Hosoda et al ., was shown to improve the stability of the P187S variant protein [14,15]. Since dicoumarol is a strong inhibitor, this will, however, not be of any benefit when it comes to enzyme activity. There are also other studies available where chemical chaperones have been used. This includes, for example, migalastat that is a pharmacological chaperone used to treat Fabry disease [16-18] and studies of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [19,20].\n\nIn the present study, we report on the beneficial effect of a ligand that binds to and stabilizes the NQO1 P187S variant. We have employed biophysical methods to demonstrate that this ligand, N-(2-bromophenyl)pyrrolidine-1-sulfonamide (BPPSA), induces structural properties very similar to that of the wildtype protein. Moreover, it could be shown that, as a result of the stabilizing effect, BPPSA improves the enzymatic activity of the NQO1 P187S variant in vitro .\n\n## Experimental procedures\n\n## Reagents\n\nAll chemicals and reagents were of highest quality available either from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA), Carl Roth GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany), or Thermo Fisher\n\nScientific (Waltham, MA, USA) unless otherwise mentioned. Purification columns were obtained from GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, UK). Trypsin was from Promega (Madison, WI, USA). Labeled ammonium sulfate was from CortecNet (Voisins-Le-Bretonneux, France). The investigated ligand BPPSA was purchased from Enamine LLC (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA).\n\n## Molecular cloning, heterologous protein expression, and purification of NQO1\n\nThe cloning of NQO1 and the generation of the NQO1 P187S variant have been described previously [13]. Briefly, the NQO1 gene optimized for expression in Escherichia coli was obtained from GeneArt (Carlsbad, CA, USA) and cloned into a pET28a vector from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). The NQO1 P187S variant was generated with the Quick Change II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit from Agilent (Santa Clara, CA, USA) by the use of gene-specific primers from Eurofins (Luxembourg). The protein expression and purification were performed according to the procedure described by Lienhart et al . [13]. In brief, the protein expression was carried out in lysogeny broth (bacto-tryptone 10 g L \/C1 \/C0 1 , bacto yeast extract 5 g L \/C1 \/C0 1 , NaCl 5 g L \/C1 \/C0 1 ) containing 50 l g L \/C1 \/C0 1 kanamycin. The main culture was inoculated with 5% of an overnight culture and incubated at 37 ° C at 140 r.p.m. in shake flasks in a HT Multitron Standard shaking system (Infors AG, Basel, Switzerland) until an OD600 of around 0.8 was reached, and the cultures were then induced with 0.5 mM isopropylb -D-thiogalactoside and grown for 16 h at 25 ° C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4420 g at 4 ° C for 10 min, resuspended in 1% saline solution, and thereafter centrifuged again at 4570 g for 45 min. The cell pellets were then resuspended in 2 mL g \/C1 \/C0 1 pellet of lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.0) and 1 mg FAD, 10 l L protease inhibitor cocktail for histidine-tagged proteins (Sigma-Aldrich), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and 20 l g mL \/C1 \/C0 1 lysozyme were added to 25 mL of the cell suspension. Next, the cells were disrupted by sonication in a Sonopuls glass rosette cell RZ (Bandelin, Berlin, Germany) on ice with a Labsonic L instrument from Braun Biotech. International (Berlin, Germany) with 120 W for 6 9 3 min and 3-min pause in between each cycle. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 38 470 g at 4 ° C for 1 h. The supernatant was then loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap FF column equilibrated with lysis buffer, whereafter the column was washed with wash buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, pH 7.0). Proteins were finally eluted with elution buffer (50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, pH 7.0). The protein-containing fractions were combined and concentrated by using centrifugal filter units with 10 kDa cutoff from Pall Life Sciences (Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The concentrated protein was further\n\npurified by size-exclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16\/ 60 Superdex 200 prep grade column equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0, at 4 ° C. The column was connected to an € AKTA FPLC system (GE Healthcare). The purity of the protein-containing fractions was checked using SDS\/PAGE, and the pure fractions were then pooled and concentrated by using centrifugal filter units and finally rebuffered with a PD-10 desalting column to 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0. The protein was then shock frozen and stored at \/C0 80 ° C.\n\n## Virtual screening\n\nPotentially stabilizing compounds were found by in silico docking using DOCK blaster (http:\/\/blaster.docking.org, University of California, SF, USA) and refinement [21]. Dockings were performed using the available structure of the NQO1 P187S variant (PDB code 4CET). In order to search for possible lead compounds, the complete ZINC database (http:\/\/zinc.docking.org, University of California, SF, USA) with commercially available lead compounds was used. Based on the screening results, eight compounds were selected for the initial experimental screening.\n\n## Thermal shift assay\n\nThe melting point determinations were performed as described by Forneris et al . and Ericsson et al . [22,23]. Briefly, 150 l M NQO1 WT or P187S variant in 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.0 with or without BPPSA at a concentration of 2 mM were mixed in a white 96-well RT-PCR plate (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) sealed with optical-quality sealing tape (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The plate was heated from 20 to 95 ° C, with 0.5 ° C steps, in a CFX Connect TM Real-Time PCR Detection System from Bio-Rad Laboratories, and the change in fluorescence due to the release of the FAD cofactor upon unfolding of the protein was detected. The thermal stability was analyzed using the CFX MANAGER 3.0 software from Bio-Rad Laboratories.\n\n## UV\/Vis absorption difference titration\n\nThe difference absorption spectra were recorded with a Specord 200 plus spectrophotometer from Analytik Jena (Jena, Germany) at 25 ° C in tandem cuvettes from Hellma Analytic (Mullheim, € Germany) as described by Lienhart et al . [13]. For the measurement, 800 l L of NQO1 WT or NQO1 P187S variant in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, at a concentration of 40 l M in the measurement cell, was titrated with BPPSA (in 2l L steps from a 2 mM stock, dissolved in 50% v\/v EtOH). The same volume of compound was added to the buffer chamber in the reference cuvette at the same time as the same volume of 50% EtOH in buffer was added to the protein chamber in the reference cuvette in order to always keep the dilution the same in all chambers. For the analysis, the sum of the absorption values at 444 and 496 nm in the case of NQO1 WT and 440 and 491 nm in the case of the NQO1 P187S variant were plotted against the concentration of BPPSA.\n\n## Isothermal titration calorimetry\n\nIsothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements were performed using a PEAQ-ITC (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, Worcestershire, UK). In the experiments, 380 l M NQO1 WT or P187S variant were used with 23 and 13 l M BPPSA, respectively. All samples were prepared in 50 mM HEPES at pH 7.0 with 1% DMSO in the final samples. The experiments were performed at 25 ° C, with a stirring speed of 500 r.p.m. One experiment consisted of 13 14 -injections with a volume of 2.8 l L and an injection duration of 5.6 s (including the first injection with a volume of 0.4 l L), and the spacing used was 250 s. Control experiments were performed by titrating 380 l M NQO1 WT or NQO1 P187S into a buffer with 1% DMSO. The analysis was done with the MICROCAL PEAQ-ITC Analysis Software (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, Worcestershire, UK) using one set of sites fitting model and the point-topoint method for subtraction of the control data.\n\n## Steady-state kinetics\n\nMeasurements of the initial velocity were performed for the NQO1 wild-type and P187S variant in the presence and absence of BPPSA by using a Specord 200 plus spectrophotometer (Analytik Jena) at 25 ° C. The assays were performed in 50 mM HEPES containing 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.0, with NADH as electron donor and menadione as electron acceptor. For all components, the concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. The reaction mixture for the assay performed with variation of the concentration of NADH contained 2.5 nM NQO1 WT or 20 nM NQO1 P187S variant, 200 l M menadione ( e 333 nm = 2450 M \/C0 1 \/C1 cm \/C0 1 , prepared in EtOH with a final concentration of 1% v\/v), 1 -10 mM NADH ( e 340 nm = 6220 M \/C0 1 \/C1 cm \/C0 1 ), and 10 times the K D of FAD equal to 0.6 l M for NQO1 WT and 4.2 l M for the NQO1 P187S variant, respectively. For the assay with variation of the concentration of menadione, the reaction mixture consisted of 1 nM NQO1 WT or 5 nM NQO1 P187S variant, 10 mM NADH, 45 l M cytochrome C, and 2.5 -40 l M menadione in the case of NQO1 WT and 5 60 -l M in the case of NQO1 P187S variant (dissolved in EtOH with a final concentration of 1% v\/v) and 0.6 and 4.2 l M of FAD for wild-type and P187S variant, respectively. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 2 min at 25 ° C and the reaction was initiated by addition of the enzyme, and the decrease in absorption of NADH was measured at 400 nm (determined for these measurements) in the case of variation of NADH and the increase at 555 nm due to the reduction of cytochrome C\n\nin the case of variation of menadione. The slope corresponding to the first 20 s was used for the analysis for all conditions. The kinetic parameters were determined using the GRAPHPAD PRISM 5.01 software for Windows (La Jolla, CA, USA).\n\n## Inhibition and activation assays\n\nThe inhibiting and activating effects of BPPSA on NQO1 WT and NQO1 P187S variant were investigated by using a Specord 200 plus spectrophotometer (Analytik Jena) at 25 ° C. The concentrations for the used components were all determined spectrophotometrically. The final reaction mixture contained 500 l M NADH ( 340 nm e = 6220 M \/C0 1 \/C1 cm \/C0 1 ), 200 l M menadione ( e 333 nm = 2450 M \/C0 1 \/C1 cm \/C0 1 , dissolved in EtOH), 10 nM NQO1 WT or 20 nM NQO1 P187S variant, and 0 -316 l M BPPSA (dissolved in EtOH) for the inhibition assay and 0 -1600 nM BPPSA for the activation assay, respectively. In the case of NQO1 P187S variant, a final concentration of 4.2 l M FAD was included in the assay. The reaction mixtures were first incubated for 2 min at 25 ° C, whereafter the reaction was started by addition of enzyme. For the activation assay, BPPSA was coincubated with the protein for at least 30 min before the reaction was started. The decrease in absorption caused by the breakdown of NADH was measured at 380 nm. For analysis, the slope corresponding to the first 30 s of the reaction was used. The IC50 values were calculated using the GRAPHPAD PRISM 5.01 software for Windows.\n\n## Limited proteolysis\n\nNQO1 WT and NQO1 P187S variant at a concentration of 15 l M in 50 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, and pH 7.0 were digested with trypsin from Promega at a final concentration of 2 l g mL \/C1 \/C0 1 at 37 ° C. Samples were prepared with protein (NQO1 WT or NQO1 P187S variant) and 30 l M FAD and with protein, 30 l M FAD, and 300 l M BPPSA. Trypsin was preincubated at 37 ° C for 15 min where, after the digestion was started, samples were taken out after specific time points (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160 min, and overnight for 18 h), and the reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer followed by boiling at 95 ° C for 10 min. The samples were then analyzed by SDS\/PAGE. [13,24].\n\n## MALDI-TOF MS\n\nThe protein bands from the SDS\/PAGE were cut out, washed, and destained. The protein samples in the gel were reduced by 10 mM dithiothreitol and the cysteines were alkylated by 55 mM iodoacetamide. The proteins in the gel were then digested with trypsin at 37 ° C over night, whereafter peptides were extracted from the gel by using a buffer containing 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid. The extraction buffer was then evaporated in an ISS100 SpeedVac \/C210 system (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for\n\n2 h. The peptide mixtures were dissolved in double distilled water and 0.1% TFA and desalted with ZipTip (Millipore Merck, Burlington, MA, USA). The purified samples were spotted on a MALDI plate together with the matrix acyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (10 mg mL \/C1 \/C0 1 in a 1 : 1 v\/v ratio). After a washing step with cold double distilled water and 0.1% TFA, spectra were then recorded on a Micromass TofSpec 2E in reflectron mode with an accelerating voltage of + 20 kV. A calibration of the instrument was done with a poly(ethylene glycol) mixture (Sigma-Aldrich), and ProteoMass ACTH fragment 18 39 MALDI-MS Stan--dard (Sigma-Aldrich) was used as the calibration standard for peptides. The spectra were analyzed with MASSLYNX 4.1 (Micromass UK Limited, Wilmslow, UK) and compared to peptide fragments predicted by PeptideMass [25].\n\n## 15 N-Labeling of NQO1 WT and the NQO1 P187S variant\n\nFor the expression of the 15 N-labeled proteins, a minimal medium containing 6.8 g L \/C1 \/C0 1 Na2HPO4, 3 g L \/C1 \/C0 1 KH2PO4, 0.5 g L \/C1 \/C0 1 NaCl, 1 g L \/C1 \/C0 1 15 NH4Cl, 3 g L \/C1 \/C0 1 glucose, 1 l g L \/C1 \/C0 1 biotin, 1 l g L \/C1 \/C0 1 thiamine, 50 l g mL \/C1 \/C0 1 kanamycin, and 1 mL 1000 9 microsalts (150 mM CaCl2, 20 mM, FeCl3, 50 mM H3BO3, 150 l M CoCl2, 800 l M CuCl2, 1.5 mM ZnCl2, and 15 l M (NH4)6Mo7O24 4H2O) was used. \/C1 Except for this difference in medium composition, the protein expression was carried out as described under the section Molecular cloning, heterologous protein expression, and purification of NQO1.\n\n## NMR spectroscopy\n\nFor NMR acquisitions, 15 N-labeled NQO1 WT or NQO1 P187S variant was dialyzed into a HEPES buffer (50 mM, pH 6.5) to final concentrations of 300 l M NQO1 WT and 530 l M NQO1 P187S variant, respectively. To each sample, 10% 2 H2O was added for field-frequency locking. BPPSA was added to final concentrations of 440 l M in the case of NQO1 WT and 680 l M in the case of the NQO1 P187S variant. All spectra were recorded at 300 K on a Bruker Avance III 700 MHz NMR spectrometer, equipped with a 5 mm cryogenically cooled TCI probe with z-axis gradients. Two-dimensional 1 H- 15 N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQCs) were acquired with data matrices of 2048 9 128 data points. Forty-eight scans were recorded for each increment, and 60 ° phase-shifted squared sine-bell window functions were applied in both dimensions prior to Fourier transformation using TopSpin 3.1.\n\n## Small-angle X-ray scattering\n\nSmall-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data for solutions of the bound or free ligand forms of NQO1 WT and P187S variant in the presence of the FAD cofactor were recorded\n\non an in-house SAXS instrument (SAXSpace, Anton Paar, Graz, Austria) equipped with a Kratky camera, a sealed X-ray tube source, and a Mythen2 R 1K Detector (Dectris). The scattering patterns were measured with a 60-min exposure time (60 frames, each 1 min) with a solute concentration of 200 l M. Radiation damage was excluded on the basis of a comparison of individual frames of the 60min exposures, wherein no changes were detected. A range of momentum transfer of 0.010 &lt; s &lt; 0.63 A \/C23 \/C0 1 was covered (s = 4 p sin( h )\/ k , where 2 h is the scattering angle and k is the X-ray wavelength, in this case 1.5 A). \/C23\n\nAll SAXS data were analyzed and processed using the SAXS analysis package (Anton Paar, version 3.0). The data were desmeared using GIFT [26]. Forward scattering (I(0)), radius of gyration, ( R g ), maximum dimension ( D max), and interatomic distance distribution function ((P(r)) were computed with GNOM [27]. The masses of the solutes were evaluated based on their Porod volume.\n\n## Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry\n\nA series of 2l L aliquots of 200 l M wild-type NQO1 as well as the P187S variant, preincubated with 4.9 l M FAD, were diluted 1 : 20 with deuteration buffer (10 mM HEPES, pD 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 10 mM MgCl2). Analogous dilutions were prepared with wild-type and variant samples preincubated with 750 l M BPPSA and 4.9 l M FAD to achieve the same final protein concentrations. Ligand concentrations in the labeling reaction are still 4.6and 1.9fold above the K D for the interaction of BPPSA with wildtype NQO1 and the P187S variant, respectively.\n\nIndividual time points of the labeling reaction were sampled by removing 7.5 l L after 10, 60, 360, and 2400 s and immediate quenching with 52.5 l L ice-cold buffer of 200 mM ammonium formate (pH 2.6) in the presence of 2.7 M urea. Samples were then injected into a cooled HPLC setup described in detail previously [28]. Hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) data were analyzed using the software package Hexicon 2 [29].\n\n## Crystallization and crystal structure determination\n\nNQO1 WT was cocrystallized with BPPSA using the vapor diffusion method employing different commercial crystallization screens (Index, PEG\/Ion from Hampton Research and Morpheus Screen from Molecular Dimensions). Drops were prepared by mixing 0.5 l L of the protein solution (at a concentration of 17 mg mL \/C1 \/C0 1 in 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, preincubated with a saturated solution of the ligand at a concentration of 750 l M) with an equal volume of mother liquor using an ORYX 8 pipetting robot (Douglas Instruments Ltd, Hungerford, Berkshire, UK). The trays were incubated at 20 ° C. Yellow crystals were observed after approximately 1 month in various conditions. Diffracting crystals were obtained from the original condition A5 of the PEG\/Ion screen consisting of 0.2 M magnesium chloride hexahydrate and 20% w\/v polyethylene glycol 3350, pH 5.9.\n\nDiffraction data were collected to a maximum resolution of 2.76 A on beamline P11 ( \/C23 k = 1.0089 A) at DESY Ham\/C23 burg, Germany. The crystals were trigonal (space group P 3112) with unit-cell parameters a = b = 121.37 A \/C23 and c = 158.25 A. \/C23 The data were processed using iMOSFLM [30] and programs from the CCP4 suite [31]. The structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program PHASER [32] with the structure of the NQO1 variant P187S (PDB code: 4CET) as a template. The structure was refined using the programs Coot [33] and PHENIX [34]. Clear residual electron density was observed for FAD bound to each of the four chains in the asymmetric unit. Only in one of the four independent active sites (associated with chain B), the difference in electron density was clear enough to interpret it as a molecule of BPPSA in two alternate orientations. Detailed statistics pertaining to data processing and structure refinement are summarized in Table 1. Atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under the accession number 6FY4.\n\n## Docking calculations\n\nBPPSA was docked into the active site of NQO1 WT with the program ADFR [35] using 104 genetic-algorithm optimization runs with a maximum of 2.5 million energy evaluations per run. The receptor was kept rigid, while the ligand BPPSA was flexible.\n\n## Results\n\n## Virtual and initial in vitro screening of possible stabilizing ligands\n\nInitially, the goal of the virtual screening was to identify a small molecule that binds to the P187S variant protein and may exert a stabilizing effect. Toward this aim, the molecules in the ZINC database were docked and ranked according to their binding free energy. A subset, including eight of the best hits, was selected for an initial in vitro screening using the ThermoFAD method (Table S1), where BPPSA stood out as the ligand leading to the largest stabilizing effect, with an increase in melting temperature of 1 ° C for the wildtype and 2.5 ° C for the NQO1 P187S variant. Because of the promising stabilizing effects of BPPSA, further experiments were performed investigating the effects of this compound on the stability and activity of NQO1 P187S variant as well as NQO1 WT.\n\nTable 1.

In Fig. 1 the resulting SDS\/ PAGE analyses are displayed. Apparently, both the wild-type and P187S variant proteins are partly stabilized in the presence of BPPSA. However, the stabilizing effect is different for the two proteins and correlates with the loss of peptides at the C terminus (Fig. 1C).\n\nThe binding of BPPSA to the wild-type and the P187S variant could also be monitored using difference UV Vis absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2, -titration of BPPSA to wild-type protein produced a sharp endpoint, whereas the equivalent experiment with the P187S variant led to a biphasic binding behavior. In both cases, however, the absorption changes are similar and clearly indicate that binding of BPPSA affects the absorption properties of the FAD cofactor in the protein.\n\nNext, the binding of the ligand was further investigated by ITC. The dissociation constants for the binding of BPPSA to the wild-type and P187S variant could be determined to be 7.95 \/C6 0.80 and 20.0 \/C6 0.41 l M, respectively (Fig. 3 and Table S2).\n\n## NMR spectroscopy, SAXS, and HDX-MS measurements\n\nTo analyze the structural effects of BPPSA on the properties of the wild-type and P187S variant protein in solution, we employed different biophysical methods that report on folding, shape, and accessibility of proteins. Recently, we have demonstrated that the 1 H- 15 N-HSQC spectra of wild-type NQO1 and the P187S variant exhibit significant differences: While the HSQC of the wild-type enzyme is indicative of a relatively rigid and well-structured protein, the P187S variant mainly showed signals in the random coil region, which likely result from increased flexibility of this variant (Fig. 4A) [13]. Remarkably, the HSQCNMR spectrum for the NQO1 P187S variant improved in the presence of BPPSA indicating that the mobility of amino acid residues is substantially reduced (Fig. 4B). In fact, the HSQC spectrum of the P187S variant in the presence of BPPSA is similar to wild-type NQO1 and virtually identical to wild-type NQO1 in the presence of BPPSA, as shown in Fig. 4, panels C and D, respectively. This also confirmed that the ligand binds the wild-type and the P187S variant at the same site.\n\nSAXS measurements confirmed that both wild-type and the P187S variant protein occur as dimers in solution. However, the P187S variant featured an increase in both radius of gyration ( R g ) and maximum distance ( D max) compared to the wild-type protein ( R g of 2.60 and 3.04 nm, D max of 8 and 11 nm for wildtype and the variant protein, respectively). This indicates a more extended conformation of the P187S variant dimer compared to the wild-type protein, as similar observations have previously been reported [13,36,37]. The addition of BPPSA led to a decrease in both R g and D max for the P187S variant, whereas no significant changes were observed for the wild-type protein ( R g of 3.04 and 2.69 nm and D max of 11 and 9 nm, for the P187S variant in the absence and presence of BPPSA, respectively). This indicates that the\n\n## Control\n\n## BPPSA\n\n| acid positions   |   mass | NQO1 WT   | NQO1 P187S   |\n|------------------|--------|-----------|--------------|\n| 6-15             | 1108.6 | 1108.7    | 1108.6       |\n| 78-90            | 1422.7 | 1422.6    | 1422.4       |\n| 115-119          |  694.3 | 694.4     | 694.3        |\n| 202-209          |  986.5 | 986.6     | 986.6        |\n| 252-262          | 1151.6 | 1151.6    |              |\n| 263-271          | 1015.5 |           |              |\n\nFig. 1.

Therefore, wild-type NQO1 was cocrystallized with BPPSA, and the structure was determined to a resolution of 2.7 A. \/C23 As shown in Fig. 5C, the overall structure of the protein is identical to the previously described structures of wild-type NQO1 and the P187S variant [13].

Each protomer exhibits a\n\nWe observed residual electron density in one of the four crystallographically independent active sites. Although this density was rather weak (Fig. 6), we interpreted it as BPPSA bound to the active site of NQO1, consistent with binding modes of the ligand obtained by molecular docking calculations [39]. In these binding modes, the bromophenyl group is stacked against the isoalloxazine ring (Fig. 5C,D) and is otherwise surrounded by mostly aromatic residues. This aromatic portion of the ligand is best represented by the residual electron density, whereas the position of the sulfonyl and pyrrolidine moieties is less welldefined.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFig. 5.

From inhibition assays without coincubation with BPPSA and NQO1, IC50 values were calculated from the inhibition curves displayed in\n\nFig. 7A, which was found to be 8.6 \/C6 1.1 and 26.2 \/C6 1.2 l M for wild-type NQO1 and the P187S variant, respectively. However, if the protein is incubated with a low, noninhibitory concentration of BPPSA, an activation effect can be observed, with an increase in activity, especially, for the P187S variant as can be seen in Fig. 7B.

Under the same conditions, only a minor increase in activity could be observed for the wild-type protein.\n\n## Steady-state kinetics\n\nBased on the activation assay described in the previous section, the concentration of BPPSA that exhibited the largest increase in activity (400 nM) was selected, and steady-state kinetic parameters were determined for the wild-type and P187S variant protein. As can be seen in Fig. 7 (panels C -F) and Table 2, the presence of BPPSA resulted in an increase in k cat \/ K M for both NADH and the quinone substrate menadione in the case of the P187S variant protein. Under the same conditions, no substantial change in activity was observed for the wild-type protein.\n\n## Discussion\n\nIn the present study, we performed virtual screening with the aim to identify ligands that might have stabilizing effects on the structural instability of the NQO1 variant P187S. The shortlisted hits were further analyzed by in vitro screening experiments including thermal stability assays, absorption difference titrations, limited proteolysis, and ITC. These experiments identified BPPSA as the ligand with the best stabilizing properties. Interestingly, both the wild-type and P187S variant structures were stabilized, however, to a different degree, as was observed in limited proteolysis experiments, indicating that a larger portion of the\n\nC-terminal domain was stabilized in the wild-type compared to the P187S variant (Fig. 1). The more pronounced effect of BPPSA (note that a saturating concentration of BPPSA, i.e., 2 mM, was used in the experiments) on the thermal stability of the P187S variant indicates that a larger fraction of the variant protein is in a (partially) unfolded state as compared to wild-type NQO1.\n\nDue to the interesting effect on the protein stability, further analyses of the stabilizing effect of BPPSA were performed using more advanced techniques, such as NMR, HDX-MS, and SAXS. Based on our HSQCNMR data, it was observed that the P187S variant protein in the presence of BPPSA displayed an increased spectral dispersion, most probably due to reduced flexibility of residues in the P187S variant protein. The P187S variant also exhibited a more compact conformation, similar to that of the wild-type, in the presence of BPPSA as shown by SAXS measurements. Finally, HDX-MS experiments revealed in detail that the flexible C-terminal domain of the protein was stabilized. Consequently, these experiments have illustrated that the P187S variant in the presence of BPPSA repopulates a conformation similar to the wild-type, in particular with regard to the C-terminal domain. This is consistent with other data showing that the C terminus is largely destabilized in the P187S variant, leading to the loss of the FAD cofactor and consequently of the enzymatic activity [13].\n\nThe determination of the crystal structure further demonstrated that BPPSA binds to the active site, where it seems to interact with the residues Tyr-127 and Thr-128. Since binding of BPPSA in or near the active site could potentially compromise the activity of the enzyme, the possible inhibitory effect as well as steady-state kinetic parameters were determined, showing that coincubation of BPPSA with the enzyme (in the presence of excess flavin cofactor) leads to a substantial increase in catalytic efficiency of the P187S variant protein. Hence, under ideal conditions, it is possible that BPPSA can be used to rescue the enzymatic activity in vitro . The most probable reason for the advantageous effect on the activity seems to be connected to a higher loading of FAD cofactor to the P187S variant protein, consequently resulting in a higher population of holoenzyme present during the reaction. This also explains the minor differences observed in the activity of the wild-type enzyme, since the FAD cofactor was reported to bind approximately 7 times tighter as compared to the P187S variant protein [13].\n\nIn the present study, we have demonstrated the potential of a small molecule to rescue the stability of\n\nFig. 7.

There are already examples available where pharmacological chaperones are studied or in use as treatment. One example is the treatment of the lysosomal storage disorder in Fabry disease with the chaperone migalastat that stabilizes the misfolded protein a -galactosidase A during the transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the lysosome [16-18]. Another example is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, where polymerization of alpha-1 antitrypsin possibly could be prevented by a chemical chaperone [19,20]. Thus, chemical chaperones may prove very useful as a complement in therapeutic intervention strategies targeting diseases associated with protein instability.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the Austrian Fonds zur Forderung € der wissenschaftlichen Forschung (FWF) through project P22361 to PM and KG.

Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) functionally reversing PRKN ubiquitination are critical in controlling the magnitude of PRKNmediated mitophagy process. However, potential DUBs that directly target PRKN and antagonize its promitophagy effect remains to be identified and characterized. Here, we demonstrated that USP33\/VDU1 is localized at the outer membrane of mitochondria and serves as a PRKN DUB through their interaction. Cellular and in vitro assays illustrated that USP33 deubiquitinates PRKN in a DUB activity-dependent manner. USP33 prefers to remove K6, K11, K48 and K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates from PRKN, and deubiquitinates PRKN mainly at Lys435. Mutation of this site leads to a significantly decreased level of K63-, but not K48-linked PRKN ubiquitination. USP33 deficiency enhanced both K48- and K63-linked PRKN ubiquitination, but only K63-linked PRKN ubiquitination was significantly increased under mitochondrial depolarization. Further, USP33 knockdown increased both PRKN protein stabilization and its translocation to depolarized mitochondria leading to the enhancement of mitophagy. Moreover, USP33 silencing protects SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells from the neurotoxin MPTP-induced apoptotic cell death. Our findings convincingly demonstrate that USP33 is a novel PRKN deubiquitinase antagonizing its regulatory roles in mitophagy and SH-SY5Y neuron-like cell survival. Thus, USP33 inhibition may represents an attractive new therapeutic strategy for PD patients.\n\nAbbreviations: CCCP: carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone; DUB: deubiquitinating enzymes; MPTP: 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine; OMM: outer mitochondrial membrane; PD: Parkinson disease; PINK1: PTEN induced kinase 1; PRKN\/PARK2: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; ROS: reactive oxygen species; TM: transmembrane; Ub: ubiquitin; UBA1: ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 1; UBE2L3\/UbcH7: ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 L3; USP33: ubiquitin specific peptidase 33; WT: wild type.\n\n## Introduction\n\nMutations of human PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1) and the ring-like E3 ubiquitin ligase PRKN have been linked to earlyonset familial PD [1]. PINK1-PRKN axis plays a crucial role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis through triggering mitochondrial elimination (mitophagy) [2], during which PINK1-dependent phosphorylation of both PRKN and its ubiquitin is critical in PRKN activation which subsequently ubiquitinates several downstream targets, in particular ' outer membrane of mitochondria (OMM) ' proteins [2,3]. As ubiquitination and deubiquitination processes are delicately balanced, deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) that counteract PRKN through reversing ubiquitination are critical in regulating the magnitude of PRKN-mediated mitophagy as unregulated mitophagy is likely to result in a massive cell death.\n\nantagonized PRKN in the depolarized mitochondria by opposing PRKN-mediated ubiquitination of OMM proteins, but not the ubiquitination status of PRKN itself [2,4]. USP8 was shown to directly deubiquitinate PRKN, however, its role was mainly removing K6-linked Ub conjugates and moreover, its silencing inhibited rather than promoted the extent of mitophagy by delaying PRKN translocation to depolarized mitochondria [5].\n\nExtensive efforts in search of PRKN-specific DUBs resulted in the identification of USP15 and USP30 that effectively\n\nCONTACT\n\nYongliang Zhao zhaoyongliang@big.ac.cn\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSciences, Beijing 100101, China\n\n*These authors contributed equally to this work\n\nSupplemental data for this article can be accessed here\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nTo search for unknown DUBs of PRKN, we performed immunoprecipitation (IP) and mass spectrometry analyses using the lysates of Flag-PRKN overexpressed U2OS cells, and identified deubiquitinase USP33\/VDU1 in the IP precipitates. USP33, a VHL (von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor) protein-interacting deubiquitinating enzyme [6], has been shown to deubiquitinate multiple proteins involved in diverse cellular functions: ADRB\/ β -adrenergic receptor recycling [7], vertebrate commissural axon guidance [8], macroautophagy\/\n\nReceived 28 January 2019 Revised 29 July 2019 Accepted 31 July 2019\n\n## KEYWORDS\n\nApoptosis; mitophagy; PRKN\/parkin; ubiquitination; USP33 deubiquitinase\n\nautophagy and innate immune response [9], centrosome amplification [10] and cancer cell migration [11,12]. Endogenous USP33 is localized to the endoplasmic reticulumassociated structure [13], but its cellular functions are not clearly elucidated. This study provides the evidence for the first time that USP33 is localized at the outer membrane of mitochondria, and deubiquitinates PRKN through their physical interaction. USP33 knockdown promotes the recruitment of PRKN to depolarized mitochondria leading to an enhanced mitophagy versus a significantly decreased apoptotic cell death induced by a neurotoxin: 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). USP33 selectively removes K6, K11, K48 and K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates from PRKN. Furthermore, USP33 deubiquitinates PRKN at Lys435, and on depolarized mitochondria, mainly regulates K63-linked PRKN ubiquitination. Our findings convincingly established that USP33, as the deubiquitinase of PRKN, antagonizes PRKN-mediated role in mitophagy and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell survival under stress conditions.\n\n## Results\n\n## USP33 interacts with PRKN\n\nTo identify and characterize the DUBs interacting with PRKN, tandem affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry was performed on lysates of U2OS cells ectopically expressing FLAG-PRKN. We identified two DUBs in the PRKN-pull down complex: USP15 and USP33 (Table S1). It has been reported that USP15 antagonizes PRKN-mediated mitophagy without any impact on PRKN ubiquitination and its mitochondrial translocation [4]. We next examined the physical interaction of USP33 with PRKN by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay. Since EDTA in the lysis buffer might produce false-positive results in the mass spectrometry analysis [14], we then validated the specificity of interactions between PRKN and USP33 using EDTA-free lysis buffer in our co-IP assays. In the Flag-PRKN affinity-isolation precipitates using anti-Flag antibody, endogenous USP33 was detected with anti-USP33 antibody (Figure 1A). Likewise, endogenous PRKN was observed in HA-USP33 pull-down complex using anti-HA antibody (Figure 1B). In vitro GST pull-down assay was also performed using purified GST-USP33 and His-PRKN proteins expressed in E. coli BL21. Purified GST-USP33 protein immobilized on glutathione Sepharose beads was incubated with His-PRKN (Figure S1). Consistent with the IP results, His-PRKN was pulled down with GST-USP33. These observations support the interaction of USP33 with PRKN.\n\nA list of PRKN deletion mutants were next constructed to determine PRKN domains interacting with USP33. The fulllength of USP33 showed a strong binding with the PRKN UBL and RING2 domains, but weakly with RING1 domain (Figure S2A). In contrast, among the various USP33 domains, including zinc finger and ubiquitin-specific protease (USP), DUSP1 and DUSP2, only USP domain showed interaction with PRKN (Figure S2B). The USP domain has been shown to possess the catalytic activity for removing K48- and K63linked Ub from polypeptides [15], indicating that USP33 may regulate the ubiquitination level of PRKN.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## USP33 deubiquitinates PRKN\n\nDemonstration of the interaction between PRKN and USP33 led us to examine whether or not USP33 deubiquitinates PRKN. The results showed that PRKN ubiquitination level was markedly reduced in GFP-USP33 overexpressed HEK293 cells (Figure 1C). Conversely, USP33 knockdown in U2OSFlag-PRKN cells led to a robust increase in PRKN ubiquitination tested with anti-PRKN antibody (Figure S3). In contrast, overexpression of the catalytically inactive USP33 C194S,H673Q mutant [9] failed to show any effect on PRKN ubiquitination (Figure 1D) indicating the DUB activity of USP33 is necessary for PRKN ubiquitination.\n\nIn vitro ubiquitination assay was subsequently performed to address if USP33 could directly deubiquitinate PRKN using the previously reported self-ubiquitination reaction system including UBA1 (ubiquitin like modifier activating enzyme 1), UBE2L3\/ UbcH7 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 L3), ATP, HA-Ub and affinity-purified recombinant GST-PRKN [16]. When GSTUSP33 proteins was included in the reaction system, PRKN was efficiently deubiquitinated in vitro by USP33 (Figure 1E).\n\n## USP33 is a novel mitochondrial transmembrane DUB\n\nAn earlier study detected the localization of USP33 protein at endoplasmic reticulum-associated structures and Golgi apparatus [13]. We then wished to determine if USP33 is localized to mitochondria using exogenously expressing GFP-USP33 in U2OS cells since commercial anti-USP33 antibody for immunofluorescence application is not currently available. In GFPUSP33-positive U2OS cells, USP33 was found to colocalize with a mitochondrial marker TOMM20 (Figure 2A), which is further validated by western blotting analysis showing the presence of USP33 protein in the mitochondrial fractions isolated from HEK293 cells (Figure 2B). The mitochondrial fraction appears to be nearly free of nuclear, cytoplasmic and ER contaminations as the markers of LMNB1 (lamin B1) for nuclear protein, TUBB\/ -tubulin for β cytoplasm and CANX (calnexin) for ER were at undetectable levels.\n\nFor further validation, a protease K protection assay was utilized to determine the sub-localization of USP33 in mitochondria. When mitochondrial fraction was treated with 100 ng\/ml proteinase K for 30 min on ice in the absence of 1% Triton X-100, USP33 and the outer mitochondrial membrane protein VDAC1 were digested, whereas the mitochondrial intermembrane space protein DIABLO\/SMAC was still present. In contrast, in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, all three proteins were digested. These findings suggest that USP33 is localized at OMM (Figure 2C).\n\nIt has been reported that some OMM proteins, like TOMM20 and TOMM70, are anchored to mitochondria through transmembrane (TM) region flanking with positively charged residues, called ' signal-anchor ' sequences [17]. The putative TM region of USP33 was predicted by TMpred program analysis (http:\/\/www.ch.embnet.org\/software\/TMPRED\\_ form.html), and amino acid residues 549-569 in its DUB catalytic domain were identified to be the potential TM. To validate this finding, a USP33 mutant with 21 amino acid residues deletion in the TM (GFP-USP33 Δ TM) was generated. Western blotting result clearly showed the presence of GFP-\n\nFigure 1.

This observation was further substantiated by immunofluorescence staining showing the colocalization of mitochondria with GFPUSP33, but not with GFP-USP33 Δ TM (Figure 2D,E). Collectively, these results illustrate that USP33 is a mitochondrial DUB with specific sub-localization to OMM.\n\n## USP33 knockdown enhances mitophagy through promoting the translocation of PRKN to depolarized mitochondria\n\nOneof the earlier events during PRKN-mediated mitophagy is the translocation of PRKN with USP33 prompted us to investigate whether or not the functional status of USP33 impacts the translocation of PRKN to depolarized mitochondria [18,19]. Using previously reported GFP-PRKN overexpressed cell model system [5], we found that upon treatment with 20 μ M mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), USP33 knockdown led to a much earlier translocation of GFPPRKNtomitochondria than siRNA control, with the starting time of \/uniFF5E 15 min and 20 min in USP33 -depleted and control cells, respectively. Upon continuous treatment, both siControl and USP33depleted cells showed a rapid increase in the percentage of cells positive for GFP-PRKN recruitment to depolarized mitochondria. Remarkably, USP33 silencing induced a significantly higher percentage of positive cells at each time-point of 15 to 60 min compared to controls. After 75 min of treatment, the percentage of positive cells in both groups reached a plateau with approximately 80% of the cells showing GFP-PRKN recruitment to mitochondria (Figure 3A,C). In our USP33 knockdown assays, a mixture (1:1) of siRNA-1 and siRNA-2 specifically\n\nFigure 2. USP33 is a novel OMM DUB.

To exclude the possible siRNA offtarget effect, each siRNA was independently validated for its capability in inhibiting USP33 expression as well as affecting PRKN recruitment to mitochondria and mtDNA clearance during mitophagy (Figure S4). The USP33 knockdown efficiency was determined by western blotting (Figure 3B). These findings clearly demonstrated that USP33 silencing accelerates CCCP-induced PRKN translocation to depolarized mitochondria.\n\nMitochondrial homeostasis is well-maintained under physiological conditions through mitophagy-mediated clearance of damaged mitochondria induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) [2,10,20]. We then used co-IP assay to examine the interaction between PRKN and USP33 in mitochondrial fraction under CCCP treatment. HA-USP33 was transiently expressed in HEK293 cells with or without 20 μ M CCCP for 2 h, and mitochondrial fraction was isolated. Interaction of USP33 with PRKN at mitochondria exists at a relatively low level but is substantially increased under CCCP treatment (Figure 3D), supporting that USP33 controls PRKNmediated mitophagy at a proper level.\n\nprotein and mitochondrial DNA content. USP33 expression was depleted in U2OS-GFP-PRKN cells followed by treatment with 20 μ M CCCP for 6 and 12 h (Figure 4C). TOMM20 protein level at 6 h of treatment showed a minimal decrease in both siControl and USP33 knockdown cells. In contrast, at 12 h of treatment, a substantial reduction in TOMM20 expression in both groups was observed. Specifically, the reduced expression was more pronounced in USP33depleted cells relative to siControl cells (Figure 4C). Immunofluorescence staining with TOMM20 also demonstrated a significant decrease in the percentage of cells with TOMM20 fluorescence staining in USP33 -deleted cells after 12 h of CCCP treatment (Figure 4A,B). It should be noted that GFP-PRKN protein level in USP33 -deficient cells was also enhanced relative to USP33 proficient cells after CCCP treatment (Figure 4A,C).\n\nGiven that the depolarized mitochondria can be eliminated by mitophagy in a PRKN-dependent manner after prolonged CCCP treatment [5], we wished to determine whether the enhanced mitochondrial translocation of PRKN by USP33 silencing is accompanied by an increased mitophagy manifested by the changed levels in TOMM20\n\nMitochondrial clearance efficiency was next examined in USP33 -depleted cells by measuring mtDNA content with an anti-DNA antibody. USP33 expression was first silenced in U2OS-GFP-PRKN cells using adenoviral shRNA, and then treated for 12 h with 10 μ M oligomycin and 4 μ M antimycin A (O-A), two mitochondrial uncouplers to induce mitophagy through inhibiting complex III of the electron transport system and Fo-ATPase, respectively [21,22]. mtDNA fluorescence density in USP33 -depleted cells was observed to be largely diminished in USP33 -depleted cells, but only\n\nFigure 3. USP33 depletion promotes PRKN recruitment to depolarized mitochondria. U2OS-GFP-PRKN cells were transfected with control siRNA (siCon) or USP33 siRNA1 + 2 (si USP33 ) for 48 h and then treated with 20 μ M CCCP. The cells were collected at indicated time-points for immunostaining with anti-TOMM20. (A) The appearance of GFP-PRKN puncta superposed on the mitochondrial TOMM20 was visualized. Scale bar: 25 μ m.

U2OS cells with an endogenous level of PRKN were employed to examine the effect of USP33 depletion on mitochondrial clearance in comparison with USP15 and USP30 that were previously shown to inhibit in vivo mitophagy by counteracting PRKN-mediated ubiquitination of its substrates [2,4]. Similar to USP30 and USP15, USP33 silencing led to a marked decrease in TOMM20 protein level determined by western blotting and immunostaining assays (Figure S5). These findings indicate that loss of USP33 expression accelerates the clearance of impaired mitochondria by mitophagy.\n\nPRKN. USP33 overexpression was found to preferentially remove the PRKN-Ub conjugates at K6, K11, K48 and K63 (Figure 5A, Figure S6), illustrating that USP33 has a marked preference for certain ubiquitin linkages.\n\n## USP33 removes K6, K11, K48 and K63-linked ubiquitin conjugates from PRKN\n\nPRKN is an E3 ubiquitin ligase undergoing selfubiquitination. It was demonstrated that all seven internal lysine residues (Lys6, 11, 27, 29, 33, 48 and 63) of ubiquitin (Ub) can serve as the potential sites for chain-elongation and mediate different endpoints such as proteasome degradation pathway or non-degradation functions [23]. To identify the preferentially targeted Ub linkages conjugated to PRKN by USP33, a series of HA-tagged Ub mutants were generated that had only one single lysine (K) with all other lysine residues mutated to arginine. Each of these mutant constructs was transfected with Flag-PRKN plasmid into HEK293 cells. These cells were subsequently transfected with GFP-USP33 or GFP -vector alone after 24 h. Immunoprecipitates with antiFlag antibody were subjected to western blotting with anti-HA antibody to evaluate the level of each K linkage-conjugated\n\nEffect of USP33 on PRKN ubiquitination during mitophagy process was also examined under CCCP treatment. We first tested the PRKN ubiquitination in total cell lysates of control and USP33silenced U2OS-Flag-PRKN cells after CCCP treatment. In siRNA control cells, CCCP treatment led to a transient increase in the level of PRKN self-ubiquitination at different time-points of 0.5, 1 and 2 h (Figure 5B), which is consistent with previous report [24]. In contrast, USP33 depletion resulted in a much higher level of PRKN selfubiquitination at each time-point upon CCCP relative to control (Figure 5B). It should be noted that CCCP treatment combined with USP33 depletion markedly enhanced the ubiquitination level of PRKN and TOMM20, whereas PINK1 or USP30 protein levels were either slightly increased or unchanged upon USP33 silencing (Figure S7), suggesting that USP33 modulates PRKN activity and subsequent ubiquitination of its substrates.\n\nIt is well established that K48- and K63-linked Ub chains mainly target the proteins for proteasome degradation and diverse signaling pathways, respectively, whereas the functional roles of K6- and K11-linked Ub chains are not very clear [23]. Since both K48- and K63-Ub linkages were identified on polyubiquitinated PRKN post CCCP treatment, we wished to verify which Ub linkage is preferentially removed from PRKN by USP33 in the absence or presence of CCCP treatment. USP33 knockdown was observed to significantly enhance the levels of both K48and K63-linked\n\nFigure 4. USP33 depletion enhances PRKN-mediated mitochondrial clearance. U2OS-GFP-PRKN cells were transfected with siCon or USP33 siRNA1 + 2 (si USP33 ) for 48 h, treated with 20 μ M CCCP for 6 or 12 h, and immunostained with anti-TOMM20.

Interestingly, only CCCP treatment led to a substantial increase in K63-, but not K48-linked PRKN polyubiquitination. In particular, K63-linked PRKN polyubiquitination was more significantly enhanced by CCCP treatment or USP33 depletion relative to K48-linked ubiquitination (Figure 5C,D). In support, USP33 overexpression preferentially reduced the levels of PRKN-Ub conjugates at K48 and K63 with or without CCCP treatment (Figure S8). These findings suggest that the augmented PRKN ubiquitination by CCCP treatment is mainly mediated by K63-Ub chain.\n\nthe findings from cycloheximide (CHX) chase assay (Figure S9), suggesting that the overall effect of USP33 depletion stabilizes PRKN protein mainly through the enhanced K63-linked PRKN polyubiquitination rather than K48-associated proteasome degradation pathway.\n\nUSP33 deubiquitinates both K48- and K63-linked Ub chain from PRKN and its depletion enhances PRKN protein level under mitochondrial depolarization (Figure 4A,C). To verify if USP33 status impacts PRKN protein stability, a methionine surrogate AHA-based metabolic labeling assay [25,26] was performed using U2OS-Flag-PRKN cells. The result showed that in comparison with siControl, USP33 depletion markedly enhances the stability of PRKN protein (Figure 5E), which is consistent with\n\n## USP33 regulates PRKN self-ubiquitination at Lys435 mainly through K63-linked Ub chains and its silencing protects SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells from the neurotoxin MPTP\n\nTo determine which lysine amino acid on PRKN protein is specifically targeted by USP33, all the 18 lysine residues on PRKN was screened by point-mutation assay (lysine mutated to arginine).

Remarkedly, Lys435 mutation led to an unchanged level of PRKN ubiquitination in both siControl and USP33 -depleted cells, indicating that USP33 primarily deubiquitinates PRKN at Lys435.\n\nOur findings that USP33 overexpression decreases the levels of PRKN-Ub conjugates at K6, K11, K48 and K63 sites led us to determine which K-linked Ub chain is specifically conjugated to PRKNLys435.WemainlyfocusedonK48andK63sincethesetwo types of chain linkages have been well-recognized as the key performers in mediating either protein stability or functional pathways. Flag-tagged WT PRKN or its mutant (K435R) in combination with HA-tagged K48 or K63 Ub was transfected into HEK293 cells. The results from immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag followed by western blotting with anti-HA showed that Lys435 mutation results in a slight decrease in K48-linked Ub conjugates, but a distinctly reduced level of K63-linked Ub conjugates on PRKN (Figure 6B). Our collective findings suggest that PRKN ubiquitination at Lys435 is regulated by USP33 through K63linked Ub chains.\n\ntested in U2OS cells ectopically expressing WT or K435R mutated PRKN. A significant enhancement in the percentage of cells with positive GFP-PRKN recruitment to depolarized mitochondria was observed in WT GFP-PRKN cells, but not in GFP-PRKN K435R cells treated with 20 μ M CCCP for 60 min (Figure 6C). Additionally, mtDNA clearance efficiency was also significantly augmented in WT GFP-PRKN cells instead of K435R mutant cells upon 12 h of treatment with 10 μ M oligomycin and 4 μ Mantimycin A (O-A) (Figure S11). These data strongly support that USP33 regulates mitophagy mainly through deubiquitinating PRKN at Lys435.\n\nThe importance of Lys435 in USP33-mediated deubiquitination of PRKN and subsequent mitophagy induction was further\n\nUSP33 depletion augments PRKN ubiquitination leading to a more efficient and orderly clearance of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy thereby probably conferring cellular survival through maintenance of mitochondrial quality. To test this possibility, apoptotic cell death was measured in siControl and USP33depleted SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 0.5 mM MPTP, a neurotoxin inducing mitochondrial-dependent cell apoptosis because of excessive intracellular ROS production [27]. In the absence of MPTP treatment, SH-SY5Y cells transfected with control siRNA showed a relatively higher level of apoptotic cell death (10.17%), which is similar with previous reports [28]. However, USP33\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 6. USP33 regulates PRKN ubiquitination at Lys435 and its silencing protects SH-SY5Y cells from the neurotoxin MPTP.

(D) Model depicting the antagonizing effect of USP33 on PRKN-mediated mitophagy. USP33 as an OMM protein interacts with PRKN under mitochondrial depolarization and regulates the magnitude of PRKN-induced mitophagy mainly through removing K63-linked Ub chain from PRKN. USP33 deficiency leads a persistent elevation of K63-linked Ub conjugates on PRKN consequently stabilizing PRKN protein and augmenting mitophagy induction. Overall, USP33 depletion promotes an efficient clearance of damaged mitochondria and potently protects neuron-like cells from neurotoxin-induced apoptotic cell death.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nknockdown significantly decreased the apoptotic cell death (7.56%, ** P &lt; 0.01 compared to control). Additionally, under MPTP treatment, both siRNA control and USP33 -depleted cells showed a significantly enhanced apoptotic cell death with 23.72% and 12.26%, respectively. Moreover, extent of apoptotic cell death observed in USP33 knockdown cells was significantly lower relative to siRNA control (Figure 6D). This finding clearly indicates a protective role of USP33 silencing on neurotoxin-exposed SHSY5Y cells.\n\n## Discussion\n\nPINK1-PRKN axis plays an essential role in clearing the damaged mitochondria selectively through mitophagy. This\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nprocess involves the recruitment of PRKN to depolarized mitochondria and PINK1-mediated Ub phosphorylation on PRKN which is critical for PRKN activation and subsequent monoand poly-Ub assembly on its substrates in a selfreinforcing cycle [20]. DUBs have the potential to suppress the effect of PRKN on removal of damaged mitochondria by mitophagy by regulating the extent of ubiquitination of both PRKN itself and its substrates. Here, we provided the conclusive evidence for the first time that USP33 located at the outer membrane of mitochondria serves as a DUB specific for PRKN. As expected, depletion of USP33 under CCCP treatment promotes mitophagy through accelerating and enhancing the translocation of PRKN to depolarized mitochondria. Furthermore, we found that USP33 specifically deubiquitinates PRKN at Lys435 and preferentially removes K6, K11, K63 and K48-linked ubiquitin conjugates from PRKN. USP33 silencing enhanced PRKN ubiquitination and subsequent protein stabilization during mitophagy, thereby protected the SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells from neurotoxin-induced apoptotic cell death. Overall, our study demonstrates that USP33 is a novel PRKN DUB potently antagonizing its effect on mitophagy through directly deubiquitinating PRKN.\n\nSeveral K-linked chains (K6, K11, K48 and K63) can be formed on PRKN [5]. Previous finding that USP33 deubiquitinates Ub chains linked via K63 and K48 [7] led us to clarify which type of Ub chain linkages conjugated on PRKN is preferentially removed by USP33. Our findings demonstrated that USP33 mainly regulates K63-linked ubiquitination of PRKN, and its silencing induces a significantly enhanced level of K63-linked ubiquitin chain formation on PRKN and subsequent PRKN protein stabilization. This result is consistent with the observations that USP33 depletion enhances translocation of PRKN to damaged mitochondria and subsequent mitophagy induction.\n\nPRKNLys435 was identified to be the main ubiquitination site regulated by USP33, which is supported by the observations that PRKN K435R cells are insensitive to USP33 depletion during CCCPinduced mitophagy. It should be noted that PRKN K435R cells under siRNA control treatment also show a slightly defective mitophagy, which possibly results from K435R being very close to the ubiquitin acceptor site of Cys431 [19] and therefore affecting the catalysis of ubiquitin transfer.\n\nNeurons are post-mitotic cells with high demand for energy production and therefore, tend to accumulate oxidative damage over time in their mitochondria [29]. PINK1PRKN-mediated mitophagy is critical in protecting neurons through maintaining mitochondrial quality and restraining innate immunity. DUBs that are capable of maintaining the balance of ubiquitination\/deubiquitination of PRKN and its substrates are potentially significant in counteracting PRKNmediated mitophagy process. USP30 serves as the deubiquitinase of OMM substrates of PRKN, and its silencing has been shown to functionally protect dopaminergic neurons against the mitochondrial toxin paraquat in PRKN and PINK1 mutant flies through restoring mitochondrial integrity [2]. We provided the novel evidence that USP33 directly deubiquitinates PRKN, and its silencing promotes PRKN translocation to depolarized mitochondria and mitophagy induction. Moreover, USP33 inhibition protects SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells from apoptotic cell death in both neurotoxin MPTP treated and untreated conditions, suggesting a potential protective role through interfering its expression under in vivo condition.\n\nMitophagy is a high-quality clearance system fundamentally for preserving cellular homeostasis and for critical processes, such as inflammation and cell death or diseases, including cancer and neurodegeneration [20]. USP33 was reported to have higher expression levels in the central nervous system (CNS), predominantly in the regions affected in PD, such as amygdala and substantia nigra [30]. Our findings suggest that USP33 inhibition may have therapeutic value in PD patient treatment through enhancing mitochondrial quality control.\n\n## Materials and methods\n\n## Chemicals and antibodies\n\nThe following chemical reagents were used: CCCP (C2759), antimycin A (A0149), MG-132 (C2211), MPTP (M0896) from SigmaAldrich; oligomycin A (Selleck Chemicals, S1478); Click-iT ™ AHA (L-azidohomoalanine; C10102), Click-iT ™ DIBO biotin (C10412), ER-Tracker ™ Red(E34250) from Invitrogen.

All inserts were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and their expression was validated by western blotting.\n\n## shRNA and siRNA\n\nWe chose the previously reported USP33 siRNA oligo sequences [10], and used Rfect siRNA transfection reagent (Bio-trans, 21014) to transfect these siRNA into U2OS cells.\n\nUSP33 siRNA1: CAAUGUUAAUUCAGGAUGATT;\n\nUSP33 siRNA2: GGCUUGGAUCUUCAGCCAUTT;\n\nUSP30 siRNA1: GCUGCUUGUUGGAUGUCUUTT;\n\nUSP30 siRNA2 GGGAUGUUGUGUGUGACAATT;\n\nUSP15 siRNA1: GGAACACCUUAUUGAUGAATT;\n\nUSP15 siRNA2: GCAGAUGGAAGGCCAGAUATT; control siRNA: UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGUTT.\n\nA mixture (1:1) of siRNA1 and siRNA2 targeting USP33 was used for knockdown assays. The adenoviral shRNA (1 and 2) for USP33 and scrambled control shRNA had the same targeting sequences as respective siRNAs.\n\n## Immunofluorescence microscopy\n\nFor colocalization of USP33 with mitochondria, U2OS cells transiently transfected with GFP-USP33 were fixed, permeabilized and immunostained with rabbit anti-human TOMM20 followed by TEXAS Red-conjugated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, TI-1000). The images were captured with Leica TCS SP8 Confocal microscope and line graph densities were quantified by ImageJ software (NIH).\n\nFor PRKN recruitment to mitochondria and mitochondrial clearance analyses, USP33 was silenced in U2OS-GFP-PRKN cells and treated with 20 μ M CCCP or 10 μ M oligomycin and 4 μ Mantimycin A. After fixation and permeabilization, cells were immunostained with anti-TOMM20 and anti-DNA antibody followed by \/uniFB02 uorescence-conjugated secondary antibody. The images were captured with a Leica confocal laser scanning microscope. The percentage of positive cells showing PRKN recruitment or TOMM20 staining were calculated. A total of &gt;150 cells were examined for each time-point, and data represents mean ± SD from three independent experiments. The mtDNA fluorescence density was calculated according to previously reported method [21]. The data represents mean ± SD from &gt;300 cells, and three independent experiments were performed.\n\n## Mitochondrial fractionation isolation and protease K treatment assay\n\nQiagen Qproteome mitochondria isolation kit (Qiagen, 37612) was used for isolating mitochondrial fraction following the manufacture s ' instruction. For proteinase K treatment assay, purified mitochondrial fraction was digested with 100 ng\/ml proteinase K (Amresco, 0706) in the absence or presence of 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, V900502) on ice for 30 min. The levels of USP33, VDAC1 and SMAC proteins were examined by western blotting.\n\n## Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay and LC-MS\/MS analysis\n\nU2OS-Flag-PRKN cells were lysed (150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 [Amresco, J619], 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM PMSF [Beyotime, ST505], 20 mM NaF, 0.5 mM benzamidine [Sigma-Aldrich, 12072], 1 mg\/ml aprotinin [Amresco, E429], 0.1 mM NaVO3, 2 mM microcystin [Millipore, 475815] and 1 mg\/ml leupeptin [Sigma-Aldrich, L2884]). After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with anti-Flag-M2 beads (Sigma-Aldrich, M8823) for 2 h at 4°C. After being washed three times with lysis buffer and heated at 80°C for 10 min in 1× Laemmli sample buffer, the binding complex was separated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) followed by silver staining and LC-MS\/MS analysis.\n\nThe EDTA-free lysis buffer was used in the following co-IP assays for validation of protein-protein interactions.\n\n## GST affinity-isolation assay\n\nHis-PRKN and GST-USP33 proteins were expressed in E. coil BL21 (DE3) cells. The purified proteins were dissolved in lysis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nbuffer and 20 μ L of 50% GST gel suspension for each sample were used. After rotation at 4°C for 3 h, the agarose gel was washed three times with lysis buffer, heated in 2× sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, and the affinity-isolated protein was analyzed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies.\n\n## In vivo and in vitro ubiquitination assays\n\nHEK293 cells were transfected with the indicated Flag-PRKN and HA-Ub for 24 h, and then transfected with GFP-USP33 or USP33 siRNA1 + 2 (si USP33 ). After 36 -48 h, the cells were treated with 10 μ M MG-132 for 3 h, lysed and immunoprecipitated with Flag M2 beads followed by western blotting using anti-HA to detect the level of PRKN ubiquitination.\n\nPurified GST-PRKN with or without GST-USP33 proteins were incubated in a mixture of ubiquitin ligation reaction (final volume, 30 μ l) containing 5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM DTT, 4 mM ATP, 1 μ g ubiquitin (Boston Biochem, U-110-01M), 200 ng E1-UBA1\/UbE1 (Boston Biochem, E-305-025), and 400 ng E2-UBE2L3\/UbcH7 (Boston Biochem, E2-640-100) at 30°C for 2 h. The reaction was terminated by boiling for 5 min in a 1× SDS sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting with the indicated antibodies.\n\n## Metabolic labeling assay for PRKN protein stability\n\nL-azidohomoalanine (AHA)-based metabolic labeling assay was performed following previously reported procedures [25,26] with some modifications. In brief, U2OS-Flag-PRKN cells were transfected with siCon or USP33 siRNA1 + 2 (si USP33 ) for 48 h. After washed with warm PBS (Beyotime, C0221A), cells were cultured in L-methionine-free DMEM (Invitrogen, 21013) for 30 min to deplete the intracellular methionine reserves, and then labeled with AHA in 10% FBS DMEM (L-methionine-free) for 4 h. Cells were continually cultured in 10% FBS DMEM at 37°C in 5% CO2 after washed with warm PBS and harvested at different time points. Click reaction was performed by incubating the cells with DIBO biotin (Invitrogen, C10412) at final concentration of 20 μ M in PBS containing 1% FBS for 15 min at 37°C. After washed three times with PBS containing 1% FBS, the cells were lysed (150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerin [Sigma-Aldrich, G2289], 1× protease inhibitor cocktail [Sigma-Aldrich, P8340]) and immunoprecipitation with anti-Flag was performed. PRKN protein level in the immunoprecipitated complex was determined by western blotting.\n\n## Statistical analysis\n\nAll experimental data were presented as the mean ± SD.

Wek\n\nAutosomal recessive mutations in the galactosidase 𝛃 1 ( GLB1 ) gene cause lysosomal 𝛃 -gal deficiency, resulting in accumulation of galactose-containing substrates and onset of the progressive and fatal neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease, GM1gangliosidosis. Here, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)approachinfibroblasts from GM1 gangliosidosis patients with recombinant human 𝛃 -gal (rh 𝛃 -gal) produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells enabled direct and precise rh 𝛃 -gal delivery to acidified lysosomes. A single, low dose (3 nM) of rh 𝛃 -gal was sufficient for normalizing 𝛃 -gal activity and mediating substrate clearance for several weeks. We found that rh 𝛃 -gal uptake by the fibroblasts is dose-dependent and saturable and can be competitively inhibited by mannose 6-phosphate, suggesting cationindependent, mannose 6-phosphate receptor-mediated endocytosis from the cell surface. A single intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered dose of rh 𝛃 -gal (100 𝛍 g) resulted in broad bilateral biodistribution of rh 𝛃 -gal to critical regions of pathology in a mouse model of GM1 gangliosidosis. Weekly ICV dosing of rh 𝛃 -gal for 8 weeks substantially reduced brain levels of ganglioside and oligosaccharide substrates and reversed well-established secondary neuropathology. Of note, unlike with the ERT approach,chroniclentivirus-mediatedGLB1overexpressioninthe GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts caused accumulation of a prelysosomal pool of 𝛃 -gal, resulting in activation of the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress. This outcome was unsurprising in light of our in vitro biophysical findings for rh 𝛃 -gal, which include pH-dependent and concentration-dependent stability and dynamic self-association. Collectively, our results highlight that ICV-ERT is an effective therapeutic intervention for managing GM1 gangliosidosis potentially more safely than with gene therapy approaches.\n\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest with the contents of this article.\n\nAuthor's Choice -FinalversionopenaccessunderthetermsoftheCreative Commons CC-BY license.\n\nThis article contains Figs.

GLB1 encodes lysosomal 𝛃 -gal, which catalyzes the stepwise lysosomal degradation of multiple galactose-containing substrates (2). Three pathogenic and biochemically distinct classes of galactose-containing substrates accumulate in lysosomes of 𝛃 -gal-deficient cells; GM1 and GA1 gangliosides, the glycosaminoglycan, keratan sulfate (KS), and oligosaccharides derived from glycoprotein metabolism (glycan substrates) (3, 4, 39). A wide spectrum of clinical phenotypes have been described for GM1 gangliosidosis. In its severest form, infantile-onset GM1 gangliosidosis patients exhibit developmental delay within the first year of life, which coincides with very low levels of residual mutant 𝛃 -gal activity, accumulation of GM1 ganglioside predominantly in neurons of the brain, and widespread CNS degeneration (2). These patients rapidly lose all motor skills, with death occurring by 2-4.5 years of age (1). GM1 gangliosidosis patients with higher levels of residual mutant 𝛃 -gal activity present with late-infantile, juvenile, and adult-onset forms of CNS-related disease progression, with a longer survival (5, 6). GM1 gangliosidosis patients also manifest several additional symptoms due to substrate accumulation in\n\n3 The abbreviations used are: GM1, monosialotetrahexosylganglioside; GA1, asialo-GM1; ERT, enzyme replacement therapy; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; MPR, mannose 6-phosphate receptor; CI-MPR, cation-independent MPR; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SV-AUC, sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation; SE-AUC, sedimentation equilibrium AUC; DSF, differential scanning fluorimetery; CZE, capillary zone electrophoresis; HDX, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry; CSF, cerebrospinal fluid; aCSF, artificial CSF; HILIC, hydrophilic interaction chromatography; APTS, 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid; KS, keratan sulfate; CNS, central nervous system; ICV, intracerebroventricular or intracerebroventricularly; AAV, adeno-associated virus; rh 𝛃 -gal, recombinant human 𝛃 -gal; PoC, proof-of-concept; IHC, immunohistochemistry; X-gal, 5-bromo-4chloro-3-indolyl 𝛃 -D-galactoside; CMV, cytomegalovirus; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; CHOP, C\/EBP-homologous transcription factor; PPCA, protective protein cathepsin A; Neu1, neuraminidase 1; 4MU, 4-methylumbelliferone; 4MU-GAL, 4-methylumbelliferyl𝛃 -D-galactopyranoside fluorogenic substrate; FA, formic acid; AF488, Alexa Fluor 488; MOI, multiplicity of infection; KO, knockout; PRM, parallel reaction monitoring; OFB, olfactory bulb; CBX, cerebral cortex; HS, hypothalamus and septum; CB, cerebellum; MB, mid-brain (containing pons and medulla); M6P, mannose 6-phosphate; IF, immunofluorescence.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evaluation of 𝛃 -gal ERT and gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis\n\nvarious systemic tissues, which coincide with less life-threatening but severely debilitating symptoms of the skeletal system, including epiphyseal dysplasia, scoliosis, and hip dysplasia (5).\n\nTheentire range of clinical phenotypes for GM1 gangliosidosis, ranging from severe to relatively mild are clustered within a narrow range of residual lysosomal 𝛃 -gal activity, from 0 to 15% of normal control levels (7, 8), suggesting that therapeutic strategies for this disease do not necessarily need to completely normalize 𝛃 -gal activity to mediate lysosomal degradation of stored substrates and prevent disease progression. In support of this, we have previously demonstrated in patient cells that only very small increases in residual enzyme activity ( ∼ 20% of normal enzyme activity levels) are sufficient to completely clear lysosomal storage material in a related lysosomal storage disease, Sanfilippo B syndrome (9).\n\nMany approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) regimes for nonneurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases have exploited the cell surface cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) targeting pathway, where mannose 6-phosphorylated glycans present on the ERT enzyme bind avidly to the CI-MPR, resulting in their internalization into clathrin-coated vesicles and delivery to lysosomes of patient cells (10, 11). More recently, intermittent intracerebroventricular (ICV)-administered ERT has been investigated to overcome the blood-brain barrier obstacle and directly deliver lysosomal enzymes into the ventricles of the brain, with cellular uptake of enzymecoinciding with substrate clearance and reversal of several aspects of well-entrenched secondary neuropathology in animal models of neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disease (12-14).\n\nIn recent years, preclinical AAV-mediated gene therapy studies have been investigated for GM1 gangliosidosis by several academic groups, with evidence of effective substrate turnover in the brain and increased survival in mouse and feline models of the disease (15-17). AAV-mediated gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis patients has also been pursued, with the first patient recently intravenously dosed in an ongoing clinical program sponsored by Axovant Sciences Ltd. 4 Preclinical studies for CNS-directed AAV-mediated gene therapy are also currently being pursued by LysoGene and PassageBio. However, a potential obstacle for developing effective gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis is the propensity for endogenous mutant 𝛃 -gal (Fig. 9 A ) and overexpressed WT 𝛃 -gal (Fig. 9 B ) to mislocalize and accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (18). Evidence of eosinophilic granules in neurons of a feline model of GM1 gangliosidosis treated with AAV-mediated GLB1 gene therapy has also been reported (17). These observations warrant investigating potential toxicity associated with developing therapies to augment 𝛃 -gal levels in GM1 gangliosidosis patients.\n\nHere, we evaluated an ERT approach to circumvent the ER anddirectly target purified recombinant human 𝛃 -gal (rh 𝛃 -gal) to lysosomes of GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts and in a mouse model of the disease via cell surface receptor-mediated\n\n4 GlobeNewswire, May 16, 2019: Axovant Announces Dosing of First Patient in Clinical Program for AXO-AAV-GM1, a Novel Gene Therapy for GM1 Gangliosidosis, Axovant, Ltd., London, UK.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nendocytosis. We also employed a lentivirus-mediated, CMV promoter-driven gene therapy approach to overexpress GLB1 in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts and further understand how retention of overexpressed 𝛃 -gal in the ER impacts on cellular stress. We then evaluated the biophysical properties of rh 𝛃 -gal at neutral and acidic pH to predict how this glycosidase is affected when retained in the pH neutral environment of the ER and in acidified lysosomes following 𝛃 -gal augmentation therapy.\n\n## Results\n\nAsingle low-nanomolar dose of purified rh 𝛃 -gal exhibits highly efficient CI-MPR-mediated cellular uptake in patient cells, which coincides with substrate clearance for several weeks\n\nFive consensus N -linked glycosylation sites have previously been reported on 𝛃 -gal produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (19). N -Linked oligosaccharide profiling of peptide: N -glycosidase F-digested glycans from three individual production and purification runs of rh 𝛃 -gal by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) suggest that ∼ 9% of the total glycan composition of r 𝛃 -gal is bisphosphorylated oligomannose (BPM7; Fig. 1 A ), the preferred glycan moiety for CI-MPR-dependent cellular uptake and lysosomal targeting (10). The purified material from lot 3 was used for all further results generated in this work. In GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts, very low-nanomolar doses of rh 𝛃 -gal cellular uptake over 24 h are sufficient to normalize 𝛃 -gal activity levels (Fig. 1 B ). Cellular uptake with rh 𝛃 -gal can be completely abolished with the addition of 8 mM mannose 6-phosphate (M6P), a known inhibitor of CI-MPR-mediated cellular enzyme uptake (Fig. 1 B ). Lower doses of M6P, down to 1 mM, are also sufficient to prevent 𝛃 -gal uptake(Fig. S1). K uptake , defined as the concentration of enzyme at half-maximal cellular uptake, is 3.4 ± 1.1 nM ( n = 13 repeats; Fig. 1 B ), with a maximal uptake capacity ( V max ) corresponding to 7338 ± 1513 nmol\/h\/mg (Fig. 1 B ). Following cellular uptake, rh 𝛃 -gal co-localizes with LysoTracker Red, a marker of acidified lysosomes, suggestive of successful delivery of enzyme to lysosomes (Fig. 1 C ). Comparative substrate profiling of GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts by CZE reveals the accumulation of a series of glycan substrates (A1G1 , A2G2 , and A3G3 ; ′ ′ ′ Fig. 1 D , with structures shown in Fig. S2). These glycan substrates can be rapidly cleared following a 4-h exposure to very low-nanomolar concentrations of purified rh 𝛃 -gal, with halfmaximal clearance ( K degradation ) being achieved at 1.5 nM, well below the K uptake (5.1 nM; Fig. 1 E , with individual K degradation rates for A1G1 , A2G2 , and A3G3 ′ ′ ′ shown in Fig. S2). In addition to the glycan substrates, GM1 ganglioside substrate was also readily detected by CZE in skin fibroblasts from a GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts by CZE (Fig. 1 D ) and by highcontent imaging with a GM1 polyclonal antibody (Fig. S3). Following cellular uptake of a single low dose of rh 𝛃 -gal (3 nM) for 18 h, lysosome-delivered rh 𝛃 -gal activity decays slowly with a half-life of ∼ 9 days in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts (Fig. 1 F ), which coincides with rapid turnover of GM1 ganglioside substrate (Fig. 1 G and Fig. S3) and glycan substrates (Fig. 1 H ) within 1 week. Furthermore, a single low dose (3 nM) of\n\n## Evaluation of 𝛃 -gal ERT and gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrhß-gal-AF488\n\nLysoTracker-Red\n\nrhß-gal-488 LysoTracker-Red\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nE\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nrh ß -g a\/ C 0 n c e n tra tio n\n\n(n M )\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evaluation of 𝛃 -gal ERT and gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis\n\nrh 𝛃 -gal delivered to lysosomes of GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts is sufficient to prevent reaccumulation of GM1 ganglioside substrate (Fig. 1 G and Fig. S3) and glycan substrates (Fig. 1 H ) for up to 6 weeks.\n\n## ICV-ERT with rh 𝛃 -gal augments lysosomal 𝛃 -gal activity in hippocampal neurons of the GM1 gangliosidosis mouse brain\n\nWhen rh 𝛃 -gal is delivered to the acidified lumen of the lysosome, proteolytic cleavage generates mature 𝛃 -gal, resulting in a ∼ 20-kDa reduction in mass (20), which can be monitored by Western blotting as an indicator of successful 𝛃 -gal delivery to lysosomes. X-gal substrate, which is specifically cleaved by 𝛃 -gal under acidic conditions, can also be used to detect 𝛃 -gal activity in situ . We initially tested both of these methods in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts to monitor the delivery of rh 𝛃 -gal to lysosomes. 𝛃 -Gal activity toward X-gal substrate in normal human fibroblasts is readily detected in situ under acidic conditions but not neutral pH conditions (Fig. 2 A ). Furthermore, as expected, 𝛃 -gal protein is predominantly detected as the mature, lysosomal enzyme in normal fibroblasts by Western blotting (Fig. 2 B ). 𝛃 -Gal activity toward X-gal substrate is not detected in situ in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts but is readily detected following a short 3-h exposure to rh 𝛃 -gal (Fig. 2 A ), which coincides with the appearance of mature, lysosomal rh 𝛃 -gal as well as the precursor nonlysosomal enzyme by Western blotting (Fig. 2 B ), suggestive of partial delivery of rh 𝛃 -gal to lysosomes. Following enzyme withdrawal and a 48-h chase, 𝛃 -gal activity toward X-gal substrate in situ remains detectable (Fig. 2 A ), with the majority of internalized enzyme by this time point corresponding to mature lysosomal rh 𝛃 -gal by Western blotting (Fig. 2 B ).\n\n(Fig. 2 D ; quantified in Fig. 2 E ). In contrast, 𝛃 -gal activity toward X-gal substrate is completely absent in the hippocampus neurons of GLB1 KO mice (Fig. 2 C ), along with 𝛃 -gal protein, as detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2 D ; quantified in Fig. 2 E ). Following an ICV administered dose (100 𝛍 g) of rh 𝛃 -gal, 𝛃 -gal activity toward X-gal substrate in hippocampal neurons is not initially detected 3 or 24 h after enzyme administration but becomes apparent after 48 h (Fig. 2 C ). These results suggest that ICV mediated delivery of enzymatically active rh 𝛃 -gal to lysosomes of neurons in the GM1 gangliosidosis mouse brain requires several days and most likely will require an intermittent ICV-ERT dosing strategy. In support of this, four ICV-ERT injections with rh 𝛃 -gal over 2 weeks result in the detection of mature, lysosomal 𝛃 -gal in brain homogenates of GLB1 KO mice (Fig. 2 D ; quantified in Fig. 2 E ), with only one of seven treated GLB1 KO mice showing elevated levels of prelysosomal rh 𝛃 -gal enzyme (Fig. 2 D , mouse 139).\n\n## ICV administered rh 𝛃 -gal exhibits broad bilateral biodistribution throughout the brain, which coincides with clearance of multiple substrates in GM1 gangliosidosis mice\n\nTo determine the time required for ICV administered rh 𝛃 -gal to reach the lysosomes of neurons in the GM1 gangliosidosis mouse brain (21), we followed a single 100𝛍 g ICV dose of rh 𝛃 -gal and evaluated 𝛃 -gal activity toward X-gal substrate at lysosomal pH in situ over a 48-h chase period. In frozen sagittal brain sections, there are strong patterns of cellular neuron-like X-gal signal in the WT hippocampus (Fig. 2 C ), a critical region of GM1gangliosidosis disease pathogenesis. In situ detection of 𝛃 -gal activity in normal hippocampus mouse neurons also coincides with the detection of mature, lysosomal endogenous 𝛃 -gal in normal mouse brain homogenates by Western blotting\n\nAsingle 100𝛍 g ICV dose of rh 𝛃 -gal into WT mice coincides with broad bilateral distribution of the enzyme throughout the brain 24 h after administration, as determined using a MS-based assay (Fig. 3 A ). Two short-term proof-of-concept (PoC) ICV-ERT dosing experiments were evaluated, commencing at 8 weeks of age or at 12 weeks of age (Fig. 3 B ), well after secondary neuroinflammation has commenced in this mouse model of GM1 gangliosidosis (22-25). Twice weekly ICV dosing in GLB1 KO mice over 2 weeks ( 2 wk PoC ; Fig. 3 B ) or weekly ICV dosing for 8 weeks ( 8 wk PoC ; Fig. 3 B ) results in the detection of mature lysosomal rh 𝛃 -gal protein by Western blotting in brain homogenates (Fig. 3 C ; see Fig. 3 D for quantification), which coincides with normalization of 𝛃 -gal activity to varying extents in individual mice (Fig. 3 E ). Weekly ICV dosing with rh 𝛃 -gal for 8 weeks in GLB1 KO mice also coincides with near-to-complete clearance of two classes of substrates in GM1 gangliosidosis brain tissue, with the GM1 and GA1 ganglioside substrates requiring a longer duration of ERT for maximal clearance, when compared with glycan substrates (Fig. 3, F - ).

ICV dosing with rh 𝛃 -gal for 8 weeks in GLB1 KO mice coincides with normalization of LAMP2 levels, as detected by IHC (Fig. 4 A ; see Fig. 4 B for quantification) and by Western blotting (Fig. 4 C ; see Fig. 4 D for quantification). GFAP, a marker for astrogliosis (Fig. 4 E ; see Fig. 4 F for quantification), as well as IBA1, a marker of microgliosis (Fig. 4 G ; see Fig. 4 H for quantification), were significantly elevated in the cortex from vehicle-treated KO mice at 3 months of age, when compared with vehicle-treated WT mice by IHC. Both GFAP levels (Fig. 4 E ; see Fig. 4 F for quantification) and IBA1 levels (Fig. 4 G ; see Fig. 4 H for quantification) were normalized in the cortex of KO mice following eight weekly ICV doses of rh 𝛃 -gal, when compared with vehicle-treated KO mice. Collectively, our results in Figs. 2-4 suggest that in a mouse model of GM1 gangliosidosis, an intermittent ICV-ERT dosing approach with rh 𝛃 -gal results in broad, bilateral biodistribution of the enzyme, which coincides with near-to-complete clearance of multiple substrates in the brain and reversal of well-entrenched secondary neuropathology. While doseranging and reaccumulation studies were not evaluated in the mousemodel, our proof-of-concept studies in patient cells suggest that a single dose of rh 𝛃 -gal is sufficient to augment 𝛃 -gal levels in lysosomes and mediate substrate clearance for up to 6 weeks (Fig. 1).\n\nold of ∼ 15% of normal residual lysosomal enzyme activity that is needed to mediate substrate turnover and prevent lysosomal storage disease progression in GM1 gangliosidosis patients (7, 8). It is therefore possible that an ICV route of rh 𝛃 -gal administration may also result in exposure of enzyme to systemic sites of disease progression in sufficient amounts to mediate substrate clearance.\n\n## ICV-ERT with rh 𝛃 -gal for 8 weeks normalizes 𝛃 -gal activity in systemic tissues, which coincides with a partial reduction in urinary A2G2 ′ substrate\n\n𝛃 -Gal activity toward X-gal substrate was detected in situ in GLB1 KO mouse brain tissue immediately following ICV-ERT in areas that appeared vascular-like (Fig. 2 C ), suggesting that ICV delivered enzyme may be gaining access to the systemic circulation. In support of this, eight weekly ICV doses of rh 𝛃 -gal in GLB1 KO mice coincides with near-to-complete normalization of 𝛃 -gal activity levels and 𝛃 -gal protein levels in the liver (Fig. 5 A ) and bone marrow (Fig. 5 B ) of the majority of animals. Whereas substrate levels in liver and bone marrow of these mice were not measured, the degree of 𝛃 -gal augmentation in liver and bone marrow is well above the critical thresh-\n\nIn our biomarker analyses of GM1 gangliosidosis mice, we observed elevated levels of the A2G2 ′ glycan substrate in the brain as well as in several systemic tissues, including liver, spleen, kidney and urine, when compared with WT littermate control mice. 4 A2G2 ′ glycan substrate was also elevated in brain tissue and urine from GM1 gangliosidosis patients, when compared with samples from normal individuals, 4 raising the possibility of utilizing urinary A2G2 ′ levels as an indicator of systemic exposure of rh 𝛃 -gal following ICV-ERT. In this study, weonlymanagedtocollecturinefromasubsetofthemicefrom the 8-week PoC study, 24 h after the final ICV administered dose of rh 𝛃 -gal. Naive GLB1 KO mice ( n = 2), along with vehicle-treated GLB1 KO mice ( n = 2), contain no detectable 𝛃 -gal activity in individual brain and liver samples (Fig. 5, C and D ), which coincides with elevated A2G2 ′ substrate in their corresponding brain and urine samples (Fig. 5, E and F ). In contrast, 𝛃 -gal activity is readily detected in the brain and liver from a single vehicle-treated WT mouse (Fig. 5, C and D n ; = 1), which coincides with no A2G2 ′ substrate being detected the corresponding brain and urine sample from this mouse (Fig. 5, E and F ). A regimen of intermittent ICV dosing with rh 𝛃 -gal for 8 weeks is sufficient to augment 𝛃 -gal activity to varying levels in individual brain and liver samples from three ICV-ERTtreated GLB1 KO mice (Fig. 5, C and D ), which coincides with clearance of A2G2 ′ glycan to varying extents in the brain and urine (Fig. 5, E and F ). Therefore, although no conclusion can be made after only eight weekly ICV doses of rh 𝛃 -gal in GLB1 KO mice, our biomarker analysis of glycan substrate accumulation in human GM1 gangliosidosis patients, 4 together with the results in a limited number of animals shown here, warrant further studies to investigate the potential of A2G2 ′ glycan as a noninvasive biomarker of rh 𝛃 -gal systemic exposure and substrate turnover during ICV-ERT clinical trials.\n\n## At low concentrations, 𝛃 -gal is predominantly a monomer and prone to destabilization at neutral pH and a stable dimer at acidic pH\n\nIn a previous study, GLB1 overexpression in feline GM1 gangliosidosis fibroblasts has been shown to result in 𝛃 -gal mislo-\n\nFigure 2.

These observations prompted us to evaluate the biophysical properties of recombinant human 𝛃 -gal (rh 𝛃 -gal) at neutral and acidic pH to predict how this glycosidase is affected when retained in the pH-neutral environment of the ER following 𝛃 -gal augmentation therapy. The monomer-dimer equilibrium of rh 𝛃 -gal was investigated by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC). Results demonstrate that rh 𝛃 -gal undergoes dynamic assembly of monomers and dimers at neutral pH (Fig. 6, A and C ) but shows no evidence of monomer-dimer equilibrium at acidic pH (Fig. 6, B and C ). To further characterize the dimerization reaction, sedimentation equilibrium AUC (SEAUC)experiments were performed under identical buffer conditions (Fig. 6 D ). At neutral pH, the rh 𝛃 -gal equilibrium data could not be fit with either a homogenous monomer or dimer model but did fit well to a monomer-dimer equilibrium model with a dissociation constant of 243 nM at 25 °C (68% confidence interval: Kd = 172-381 nM). Consistent with the SV-AUC results, no monomer-dimer equilibrium could be modeled at acidic pH, with only a homogenous dimer observed at all concentrations tested. Because absorbance optics in the AUC are capable of detecting 10% monomer, the Kd at pH 5 was calculated to be no weaker than 2 nM (Fig. 6 D ), which is roughly 100 times stronger than at neutral pH. To illustrate this substantial difference in dimerization constants, probabilities of observing rh 𝛃 -gal dimer were calculated as a function of total rh 𝛃 -gal concentration (Fig. 6 E ). Apparent from this plot, rh 𝛃 -gal dimers are much more likely to form at low-nanomolar rh 𝛃 -gal concentrations under acidic conditions, when compared with neutral pH. To evaluate the thermal stability of 𝛃 -gal under these conditions, differential scanning fluorimetery (DSF) experiments demonstrate that the protein is more stable under conditions that promote dimers (Fig. 6 F ). In support of the DSF results, the stability of rh 𝛃 -gal over 5 days at 37 °C was gradually reduced under neutral pH conditions at low concentrations (0.1 mg\/ml), when compared with rh 𝛃 -gal held under acidic conditions (Fig. 6 G ). This pH-dependent reduction in rh 𝛃 -gal stability was less noticeable when rh 𝛃 -gal was tested at higher concentrations (1 mg\/ml) (Fig. 6 H ).\n\nuptake differences at these pH conditions ( magenta ) are in and around the dimer interface proposed by Ohto et al. (26) and are consistent with a small monomer population at neutral pH, whereas most of the rest of the structure is unchanged ( cyan ; Fig. 6 ). These HDX results also provide valuable information I about the residues involved in the solution-phase dimer interface. Specifically, the crystal coordinates for residues 648-677 were not determined, presumably due to the limited proteolysis treatment and\/or an unstructured C terminus in the pH 8.0 crystallization buffer (26), whereas our HDX data suggest that in an acidic solution, residues ∼ 630-658makeupasubstantial portion of the dimer interface. In addition, residues 559-567 are involved in the crystallographic dimer interface (26), but the lack of differential uptake in our measurements suggests that they are either not involved in the solution-phase dimer interface or that the dynamics around these residues are too fast for our fastest deuterium uptake (12 s). Unfortunately, a gap in our HDXdataintheregion 63-70 precludes us from evaluating the assignment of these crystallographic interface contacts (26). Collectively, these biophysical studies suggest that rh 𝛃 -gal exhibits pH-dependent and concentration-dependent self-association and stability, with the enzyme being more prone to being an unstable monomer at low concentrations under neutral pH conditions and a stable dimer in an acidic environment.\n\n## Gene therapy and ERT approaches can both augment 𝛃 -gal activity and promote substrate clearance in patient cells for several weeks\n\nHydrogen-deuterium exchange MS (HDX) experiments are in good agreement with the AUC results described above. This is illustrated in Fig. 6 G , where the relative fractional uptake (pH 7.4 to 5.0) is overlaid on the dimer structure (Protein Data Bank entry 3THC) and is also shown in a linear format. The largest\n\nBased on our biophysical studies, we predicted that chronic GLB1 overexpression may lead to instability of monomeric 𝛃 -gal in the pH-neutral environment of the ER, where it could potentially trigger stress to this organelle. A lentivirusmediated, CMV promoter-driven WT GLB1 gene therapy approach was used to chronically overexpress 𝛃 -gal in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts and compared with an intermittent ERT approach with a single 24-h exposure to rh 𝛃 -gal. 𝛃 -Gal activity (Fig. 7 A ) and 𝛃 -gal protein (Fig. 7 B ; see Fig. 7 C for quantification) is not detected in primary fibroblasts from an infantile GM1 gangliosidosis patient. Consistent with the deficiency in 𝛃 -gal, these cells accumulate 𝛃 -gal substrates, as determined by CZE (Fig. 1 D ) and by high content imaging using a GM1 ganglioside polyclonal antibody (Fig. 7 D ; see Fig. 7 E for quantification).\n\nFigure 3.

After 28 days of chronic GLB1 overexpression in GM1 gangliosidosis patient cells, the levels of 𝛃 -gal activity reach supraphysiological levels corresponding to 355% of 𝛃 -gal activity detected in fibroblasts from a normal individual (Fig. 7 A ). In comparison, cellular uptake of purified rh 𝛃 -gal for 24 h results in normalization of 𝛃 -gal activity (Fig. 7 A ). Following withdrawal of enzyme from the uptake medium, lysosome-delivered 𝛃 -gal activity levels slowly decay over a 28-day chase period (Fig. 7 A ), with the level of 𝛃 -gal activity corresponding to ∼ 14% of normal 𝛃 -gal activity (Fig. 7 A ), a level that is sufficient to maintain GM1 ganglioside substrate clearance over the entire 4-week duration of the experiment (Fig. 7 D ; see Fig. 7 E for quantification). These results suggest that both gene therapy and ERT approaches can augment lysosomal 𝛃 -gal activity sufficiently to promote substrate clearance for several weeks. Our results also suggest that 𝛃 -gal levels do not need to reach supraphysiological levels to promote substrate clearance; only very small amounts of 𝛃 -gal augmentation are sufficient to mediate near-to-complete GM1 ganglioside substrate clearance, with as little as 14% of normal residual 𝛃 -gal activity (Fig. 7 A ) being sufficient to maintain substrate clearance in GM1 gangliosidosis patient cells for up to 4 weeks following cellular uptake of rh 𝛃 -gal (Fig. 7 D ; see Fig. 7 E for quantification).\n\n(Fig. 8 A ; see Fig. 8 C for quantification). These results are suggestive of retention of the overexpressed 𝛃 -gal in a prelysosomal compartment and are in agreement with a previous report describing mislocalization of WT 𝛃 -gal overexpressed in feline GM1 gangliosidosis fibroblasts, with the majority of enzyme co-localizing with the ER marker, PDI, suggestive of 𝛃 -gal mislocalization and ER retention (18). Chronic GLB1 overexpression in all three GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblast lines also coincides with the appearance of smaller fragments on the 𝛃 -gal Western blot (Fig. 8 A ), which were not characterized further. Based on our in vitro biophysical studies (Fig. 6), where we observed monomer-dimer equilibrium and instability at neutral pH (Fig. 6), we set out to determine whether accumulation of a prelysosomal pool of precursor 𝛃 -gal in patient cells, presumably at neutral pH, activates an unfolded protein response, where ER-resident chaperones are up-regulated to maintain ER function during periods of cellular stress.\n\n## Lentivirus-mediated GLB1 gene therapy in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts activates an unfolded protein response, whereas ERT with purified rh 𝛃 -gal does not\n\nWhereas both gene therapy and ERT approaches result in augmentation of 𝛃 -gal activity and substrate clearance (Fig. 7), these results fail to address the subcellular distribution of 𝛃 -gal. Wetherefore utilized Western blotting to distinguish between precursor, nonlysosomal 𝛃 -gal and mature, lysosomal 𝛃 -gal in GM1gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts. Chronic lentivirus-mediated GLB1 overexpression in three infantile-onset GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblast lines (Fig. 8 A ; see Fig. 8 E for patient genotypes) over a period of 8 days promotes a dose-dependent increase in the relative amounts of precursor nonlysosomal 𝛃 -gal protein levels (Fig. 8 A ; see Fig. 8 B for quantification), which coincides with a dose-dependent decrease in the relative amount of mature, lysosomal rh 𝛃 -gal protein levels\n\nIn agreement with the 2008 study by Martin et al. (18), we observed a direct correlation between chronic GLB1 transcriptional overexpression in GM1 gangliosidosis patient cells and activation of an unfolded protein response, with dose-dependent accumulation of precursor 𝛃 -gal coinciding with increasing levels of precursor PDI protein being detected in all three GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblast lines after 4 days of chronic GLB1 overexpression (Fig. S4). Interestingly, after 8 days of chronic GLB1 overexpression, precursor PDI protein levels were no longer detected in the gene therapy-treated cells (Fig. S4), suggesting that up-regulation of precursor PDI levels is a transient response to GLB1 overexpression. Instead, chronic lentivirus-mediated GLB1 overexpression for 8 days in GM1gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts coincides with dose-dependent increases in the levels of the ER-resident chaperone protein Grp78 (Fig. 8 A ; see Fig. 8 D for quantification). The increased expression of Grp78 in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts in response to virus-mediated GLB1 overexpression also appears to be time-dependent, with increased Grp78 protein levels only becoming apparent 7 days following transduction with LV-CMV-GLB1 (Fig. S5). Chronic lentivirus-mediated GLB1 overexpression for 8 days also coincides with nuclear translocation of C\/EBP-homologous transcription factor (CHOP; Fig. 8 F ), an indication of irreversible damage caused by prolonged ER stress (23). Importantly, no up-regulation in Gpr75 protein levels (Fig. S5) or CHOP translocation (Fig. 8 F ) was detected in control GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts following lentivirus-mediated transduction with the GFP reporter gene (Fig. S5 and Fig. 8 F ). Collectively, our gene\n\nFigure 4. ICV administered rh 𝛃 -gal reverses secondary neuropathology in GM1 gangliosidosis mice.

(18), suggesting that GLB1 overexpression coincides with dose-dependent (Fig. 8 and Fig. S4) and time-dependent (Fig. S5) increases in early ER markers (PDI) and late ER markers (Grp78) of the unfolded protein response, as well as CHOP translocation, an indicator of prolonged ER stress.\n\nIn contrast to a chronic GLB1 gene therapy approach, an ERTapproach with rh 𝛃 -gal cellular uptake for 24 h followed by an 8-day chase results in only the mature, lysosomal form of 𝛃 -gal being detected in cell lysates by Western blotting (Fig. 8 A ; see Fig. 8 C for quantification). Furthermore, an ERT approach with rh 𝛃 -gal does not activate an unfolded protein response at any of the doses tested, as determined by Western blotting for Grp78 protein levels (Fig. 8 A ; see Fig. 8 D for quantification). Importantly, no evidence of an unfolded protein response was observed in ICV-ERT-treated mice, as determined by Western blotting with anti-Grp78 (Fig. 2 D ; quantified in Fig. 2 F ). Collectively, these results emphasize the potential for overexpressed 𝛃 -gal to be retained in the ER of GM1 gangliosidosis patient cells following lentivirus-mediated GLB1 gene therapy, where accumulation of precursor, nonlysosomal rh 𝛃 -gal can activate the unfolded protein response and trigger ER stress. In contrast, cellular uptake of rh 𝛃 -gal by CI-MPR-mediated endocytosis from the cell surface results in direct delivery of the enzyme to acidified lysosomes, where it remains as a stable mature dimer.\n\n𝛃 -gal activity in the liver (Fig. 5 A ) and bone marrow (Fig. 5 B ) of GLB1 KO mice following eight weekly ICV doses of rh 𝛃 -gal. These observations suggest that ICV administered enzyme that is not taken up by cells in the brain can reach systemic sites of pathology, with less life-threatening but severely debilitating skeletal pathology associated with GM1 gangliosidosis potentially being amenable to ICV-ERT dosing. Although no conclusion can be made after only eight weekly ICV doses of rh 𝛃 -gal in GLB1KOmice,ourresults in a limited number of animals (Fig. 5 F ) warrant further studies to utilize urinary A2G2 ′ substrate levels as an indication of systemic exposure to rh 𝛃 -gal and a noninvasive biomarker of ICV-ERT efficacy.\n\n## Discussion\n\nOur results suggest that the biophysical properties of 𝛃 -gal, along with the therapeutic modality, should be considered whendeveloping an effective treatment for GM1 gangliosidosis and that intermittent ICV-ERT dosing is a tunable therapeutic option that can safely and precisely deliver rh 𝛃 -gal to lysosomes to clear pathological lysosomal substrates and reverse neuropathology associated with the disease. Mechanistically, CI-MPRtargeted ERT efficiently targets rh 𝛃 -gal directly to acidified lysosomes of patient cells by cell surface receptor-mediated endocytosis. Following delivery to lysosomes of patient fibroblasts, rh 𝛃 -gal is converted to a mature, long-lived dimer that can normalize 𝛃 -gal levels to promote substrate clearance for several weeks without negatively impacting the ER (Figs. 1 and 7; summarized in Fig. 9). Furthermore, as cell surface CI-MPRmediated endocytosis and targeting of rh 𝛃 -gal to lysosomes of GM1 gangliosidosis cells approaches saturation (Fig. 1 B ), the excess enzyme presumably remains outside the cell, where it is cleared by cerebrospinal fluid exchange, which occurs several times per day (27). In support of this, we observed a perivascular pattern of 𝛃 -gal activity in situ toward X-gal substrate immediately following ICV-ERT (Fig. 2 C ) along with normalization of\n\nOurbiodistribution studies with rh 𝛃 -gal suggest that a single 100𝛍 g dose of ICV administered rh 𝛃 -gal exhibits broad bilateral biodistribution throughout the brain of GM1 gangliosidosis mice as determined by utilizing an MS-based assay (Fig. 3 A ). Detection of 𝛃 -gal activity in situ using X-gal substrate suggests that whereas the majority of lysosome-delivered enzyme activity is detected in perivascular regions at early time points (3 and 24 h post-ICV-ERT; Fig. 2 C ), lysosome-delivered 𝛃 -gal activity in hippocampal neurons only becomes noticeable at the latest time point analyzed (48 h post-ICV-ERT; Fig. 2 C ), presumably by axonal transport. These observations help to explain how rh 𝛃 -gal biodistributes to lysosomes throughout the brain as well as the systemic circulation following ICV administration. Strikingly, weekly ICV-ERT dosing for 8 weeks is sufficient to promote near-to-complete substrate clearance in the brain (Fig. 3) and reversal of well-entrenched secondary neuropathology in GM1 gangliosidosis mice (Fig. 4). Although we did not performreaccumulationICV-ERTstudiesinGM1gangliosidosis mice, our results in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts suggest that a single low dose (3 nM) of rh 𝛃 -gal exhibits highly efficient CI-MPR-dependent cellular uptake and delivery to lysosomes, where the enzyme exhibits a long half-life ( ∼ 9days), which coincides with substrate clearance for several weeks (Fig. 1, G and H ) in the absence of an unfolded protein response (Fig. 8 D ). Furthermore, our results suggest that as little as 14% of normal residual 𝛃 -gal activity remaining in GM1 gangliosidosis patient cells several weeks after ERT is sufficient to mediate complete clearance of lysosomal storage (Fig. 7 A ). These patient cell-based proof-of-concept results are in agreement with our previous findings in Sanfilippo B patient fibroblasts (9), suggesting that long-lived lysosomal enzymes do not need to reach supraphysiological levels in order to be therapeutic and that enzyme activity only needs to be augmented above a critical threshold of ∼ 10-30%ofnormallysosomal enzyme activity levels to mediate substrate turnover. Future dose-ranging and reaccumulation studies in the GLB1 KO mouse model will help\n\nFigure 5.

We show that rh 𝛃 -gal can be formulated to high concentrations (20 mg\/ml) in artificial CSF and at 1 mg\/ml in a neutral pH test buffer (Fig. 6 H ), with loss of stability only being observed under neutral pH conditions over a period of several days at low concentrations (0.1 mg\/ml) (Fig. 6 G ). In contrast, rh 𝛃 -gal appears to be a stable dimer under acidic pH conditions at low concentrations (0.1 mg\/ml) (Fig. 6 G ). These biophysical properties of rh 𝛃 -gal become important following ICV administration, when the enzyme becomes rapidly diluted as it diffuses further from the injection site in extracellular fluids, which are presumably at neutral pH. Following ICV-ERT, we observed mature, lysosome-delivered 𝛃 -gal protein by Western blotting in brain, liver, and bone marrow of treated GLB1 KO mice, suggestive of the enzyme being successfully delivered to the acidified lumen of lysosomes at several sites of pathology (Figs. 3 C and 5 ( A and B )). 𝛃 -Gal activity is also detected in situ in neurons of GLB1 KO mice following a single ICV dose of rh 𝛃 -gal, further suggestive of successful delivery to acidified lysosomes (Fig. 2 C ). In our patient cell-based ERT studies, we show that rh 𝛃 -gal is targeted directly to acidified LysoTracker Red + lysosomes by CI-MPR-mediated endocytosis from the cell surface (Fig. 1 C ), where the enzyme decays very slowly over a period of 6 weeks (half-life = 9 days; Fig. 1 F ). These results collectively suggest that an ERT approach can therefore exploit the biophysical properties of 𝛃 -gal to directly target rh 𝛃 -gal to acidified lysosomes, where the enzyme can exist at low concentrations as a long-lived dimer. At the same time, from a formulation standpoint, our biophysical studies suggest that rh 𝛃 -gal can be formulated to high concentrations in a neutral pH buffer such as artificial CSF without any noticeable loss in stability.\n\nexperiments utilizing the GFP reporter gene exclude the possibility of the ER-associated toxicity arising from the lentivirus vector but rather the GLB1 gene product itself (Fig. 8 F and Fig. S5). Whereas the mechanism by which GLB1 overexpression activates an unfolded protein response and promotes ER stress in patient cells was not investigated in this study, our biophysical studies with rh 𝛃 -gal suggest that this glycosidase exhibits dynamic self-association under neutral pH conditions and is more prone to instability, particularly at lower concentrations (Fig. 6). This would suggest that retention of overexpressed 𝛃 -gal in the pH neutral compartment of the ER could potentially promote instability of the enzyme, which in turn may activate the unfolded protein response and trigger ER stress (Fig. 8; summarized in Fig. 9).\n\nThese gene therapy results in patient cells emphasize the importance of carefully monitoring the ER system with straightforward methods when developing gene therapies and, in the case of GM1 gangliosidosis, titrating the extent and duration of GLB1 dosage to avoid accumulation of transcriptionally up-regulated 𝛃 -gal in the ER. Our GLB1 gene dosage studies in Fig. 8 A suggest that gene therapy can be a safe and effective treatment for GM1 gangliosidosis, provided that the strength of the promoter driving GLB1 transcription and virus dose is carefully titrated to prevent its overexpression. In support of this, Martin et al. (18) demonstrate correct rh 𝛃 -gal localization to lysosomes in feline GM1 gangliosidosis fibroblasts expressing physiological levels of rh 𝛃 -gal and only observe mislocalization and ER retention of rh 𝛃 -gal in cells expressing above normal levels of the enzyme. In our hands, we observed a dose-dependent (Fig. 8) and time-dependent (Fig. S5) up-regulation of an unfolded protein response in patient cells overexpressing 𝛃 -gal, suggesting that careful tuning of GLB1 expression levels will help to avoid ER stress and can lead to a potentially safe and effective gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis.\n\nOur results suggest that whereas ganglioside and oligosaccharide substrates that accumulate in the absence of 𝛃 -gal contribute to fatal and devastating neurological disease progression in GM1 gangliosidosis, gene therapy approaches to add back the missing GLB1 gene product also have the potential to promote toxicity. We utilized Western blotting to demonstrate that chronic lentivirus-mediated, CMV promoterdriven GLB1 overexpression in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts leads to accumulation of the precursor form of rh 𝛃 -gal in a prelysosomal compartment, where it activates an unfolded protein response and ER stress (Fig. 8). Gene therapy\n\nAn additional safety issue that remains to be investigated for the management of GM1 gangliosidosis patients undergoing 𝛃 -gal augmentation therapy is the potential for continual 𝛃 -gal delivery to lysosomes to disrupt a multienzyme complex that exists between protective protein cathepsin A (PPCA), neuraminidase 1 (Neu1), and 𝛃 -gal (29). Whereas Neu1 is strictly dependent upon the chaperone function of PPCA for its stability in lysosomes, 𝛃 -gal is only partially dependent (2931). Our companion paper, also published in this issue of JBC, demonstrates that lysosome-targeted b-galactosidase negatively regulates neuraminidase 1 (Neu1) and promotes Neu1 deficiency in GM1 gangliosidosis (40).

In contrast, a regimen of intermittent enzyme replacement therapy dosing with rhb-Gal, followed by enzyme withdrawal, is sufficient to augment b-Gal activity levels in GM1gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts and in a mouse model of\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evaluation of 𝛃 -gal ERT and gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis\n\nGM1 gangliosidosis without promoting Neu1 deficiency (40). This is particularly important, given that Neu1 deficiency is associated with increased lysosomal exocytosis (32) and onset of the neurodegenerative lysosomal storage diseases sialidosis and galactosialidosis (29).\n\nIn summary, our results suggest that the biophysical properties of 𝛃 -gal should be considered when developing a safe and effective treatment for GM1 gangliosidosis. An ERT approach in patient cells and a mouse model of the disease circumvents the pH-neutral environment of the ER and directly delivers 𝛃 -gal to acidified lysosomes, where the enzyme resides as a stable dimer that can clear pathological substrates (Fig. 9 C ). The long half-life of lysosome-delivered rh 𝛃 -gal (9 days) may permit less frequent ICV dosing, which would need to be tested in future preclinical dose-ranging and reaccumulation studies. In contrast to the ERT paradigm, a gene therapy approach to transcriptionally up-regulate GLB1 expression and augment 𝛃 -gal levels in patient cells highlights the potential for overexpressed 𝛃 -gal to mislocalize and be retained in the ER, presumably at neutral pH, where the enzyme promotes an unfolded protein response and triggers ER stress (Fig. 9 B ). This is likely to be due to dynamic self-association and reduced stability of 𝛃 -gal under neutral pH conditions.\n\n## Experimental procedures\n\n## Production of rh 𝛃 -gal in CHO cells\n\nResearch-grade recombinant human 𝛃 -gal protein was purified from supernatants of stably transfected CHO cells generated with the GS Mammalian Gene Expression System (Lonza Biologics). Briefly, the CHO GSKO cells, grown in suspension in CD CHO medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific), were transfected by electroporation with the pXC 17.4\/ 𝛃 -gal expression plasmid. The transfected cells were directly plated in 96-well plates in the absence of glutamine. The resulting colonies were screened by the 𝛃 -gal enzyme activity assay (see below), and the clones expressing the highest amount of the protein were isolated and expanded.\n\non day 14 postinoculation, filtered, and stored at -80 °C until the purification process.\n\n## Purification of rh 𝛃 -gal\n\nRecombinant human 𝛃 -gal protein was purified via anionexchange, hydrophobic interaction chromatography and multimodal chromatography. Diluted harvest culture fluid was applied to a GigaCap Q 650M (Tosoh Bioscience) column in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and was eluted from the column in a linear gradient of NaCl. The GigaCap Q eluate was then loaded onto a butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) column in 1 M (NH4)2SO4, followed by an elution step with decreasing (NH4)2SO4 concentration. The butyl eluate was loaded onto a Capto Adhere column (GE Healthcare) in flow-through mode with 50 mM acetate\/phosphate, 135 mM (NH ) SO , pH 7. Dur4 2 4 ing the purification process, samples were analyzed by Western blotting and 𝛃 -gal activity determination using 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) substrate, reversed-phase and size-exclusion HPLC, and multiangle light scattering. Two small-scale production and purification trains were initially performed (lots 1 and 2), with a large-scale campaign used to generate ∼ 300 mg of rh 𝛃 -gal material (lot 3), which was used for all experiments described in this work. The final recovery of 𝛃 -gal was 18.3%, with a yield of 316 mg, as determined by absorbance at 280 nm. The specific activity of purified rh 𝛃 -gal was determined to be 2.6 units\/mg, with an endotoxin level of 0.02 endotoxin units\/ mg. Purified rh 𝛃 -gal was diafiltered and concentrated to 20 mg\/ml in a solution of artificial CSF (aCSF; 1 mM Na PO \/ 2 4 NaH2PO4, 148 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, pH 7.1) and stored as 1-ml aliquots at -80 °C.\n\n## Biophysical characterization of purified 𝛃 -gal\n\nThe rh 𝛃 -gal protein was produced in shaker flasks or 10-liter working volume bioreactors (Applikon Biotechnology). For fed-batch productions, the rh 𝛃 -gal-expressing CHO research clone was seeded at 0.5 × 10 6 cells\/ml in CD CHO medium or blended media containing Efficient Feed B (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The pH set point of 6.9 was controlled by CO 2 and 0.5 M NaHCO3 control loops. The dissolved oxygen set point of 30%wascontrolled by cascade of clean dry air and O 2 massflow controllers. Additional feeds and glucose were provided as glucose levels fell below 2 g\/liter. Cell culture fluid was harvested\n\nSV-AUC and SE-AUC were performed with a ProteomeLab XL-I (Beckman-Coulter) equipped with absorbance optics and an An-50 Ti eight-hole rotor. SV-AUC experiments were performed at 48,000 rpm and monitored at 230 or 280 nm. Data were analyzed with the c s ( ) method as implemented in the program SEDFIT (33). SE-AUC experiments were carried out at 12,000 and 14,000 rpm and monitored at 230, 280, and 300 nm. Equilibrium at both rotor speeds was established by evaluating the RMS difference between scans. Data were individually and globally analyzed with the following models as implemented in the program SEDPHAT: single noninteracting species and monomer-dimer equilibrium (34). DSF was performed by monitoring the change in intrinsic fluorescence as a function of temperature with the Uncle platform (Unchained Labs). Thermograms were analyzed in\n\nFigure 7.

For all experiments, 𝛃 -gal was extensively dialyzed overnight to help ensure complete buffer exchange.\n\n## GM1gangliosidosis patient fibroblast lines\n\nInfantile-onset GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts, GM05653 (35), GM03589 (36), and GM05335 fibroblasts were obtained from the Coriell Institute for Medical Research and used as a cell-based model of GM1 gangliosidosis. Fibroblasts from a normal individual, GM008339, were also obtained from Coriell. Cells were grown in GM1 complete medium Eagle's minimum essential medium (ATCC, catalog no. 30-2003) supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (not heat-inactivated), 1 × penicillin\/streptomycin (Thermo, catalog no. 15140122), and 1 × Glutamax (Thermo, catalog no. 35050061). Whereas 𝛃 -gal activity was not detected in these patient lines, the GM05653 and GM03589 lines stored greater amounts of GM1 ganglioside and glycan substrates by capillary zone electrophoresis, when compared with the GM05335 cell line. Genotyping of the GLB1 coding region in each cell line was performed by Greenwood Genetic Center (Greenwood, SC).\n\n## Analysis of rh 𝛃 -gal uptake in GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts\n\nFor cellular uptake experiments, GM1 GM05653 fibroblast cells were seeded at 12,500 cells\/well into 96-well plates. Approximately 24 h after seeding, GM05653 cells were incubated with increasing concentrations (dose range of 0.05 3 50 nM) of rh 𝛃 -gal with or without 8 mM mannose 6-phosphate disodium salt hydrate (Sigma, catalog no. M6876). In pulsechase experiments, cells were allowed to uptake enzyme for ∼ 24 h, after which medium containing enzyme was removed, cells were washed, and fresh complete medium was added to chase lysosomal rh 𝛃 -gal.\n\nCell lysates were prepared in mammalian protein extraction reagent (MPER; Thermo, catalog no. 78501). Uptake of rh 𝛃 -gal into GM05653 fibroblasts was monitored by Western blotting cell lysates with 𝛃 -galactosidase antibody from Novus (catalog no. NBP2-45731). 𝛃 -Gal uptake was also monitored by activity against 4-methylumbelliferyl𝛃 -D-galactopyranoside fluorogenic substrate (4MU-GAL; Sigma, catalog no. M1633). Cell lysates or input media containing 𝛃 -gal were incubated with 4\n\nmM4MU-GALinassaybuffer (100 mM sodium citrate, 250 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% BSA, pH 4.5) for 40 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with stop buffer (0.5 M glycine, 0.3 M NaOH,pH10.3), and fluorescence was read on a Spectramax i3 plate reader (Molecular Devices) with excitation emission of 355\/460 nm, respectively. Serial dilutions of 4MU (Sigma, catalog no. 1381) were used to establish a standard curve and calculate 𝛃 -gal activity in samples. To determine the K uptake , enzyme activity was plotted using Michaelis-Menten analysis within GraphPad Prism software. For half-life determination, GM05653 cells were incubated with a low-nanomolar dose of rh 𝛃 -gal (3.125 nM) for 18 h and then washed several times to removeanynoninternalized enzyme, and fresh growth medium was added to chase. 𝛃 -Gal activity was assayed roughly every 1-2 weeks, over a period of 6 weeks. Half-life was determined by plotting 𝛃 -gal activity into GraphPad Prism software and using nonlinear exponential decay regression.\n\nAlternatively, 𝛃 -gal uptake was monitored by immunofluorescent staining and microscopy. 𝛃 -Gal was directly conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488) prior to uptake. For the AF488 conjugation, 𝛃 -gal was reacted with a 5-fold molar excess of Alexa Fluor 488 5-SDP Ester (Thermo, catalog no. A30052) and labeled according to the manufacturer's protocol, yielding ∼ 1.2 fluorophores\/molecule. AF488 conjugation did not affect rhBgal activity.\n\nAGLB1mAbwasalso generated in-house using rh 𝛃 -gal (lot 3), which was used for high-content imaging. Granularity was calculated as total granule area in each acquired image, multiplied by the average granule intensity, divided by the total number of cells imaged. A minimum of three independent cultures in 96-well plates were imaged, with four images per well acquired at × 20 magnification. GM05653 fibroblasts were incubated with 25 nM rh 𝛃 -gal-AF488 for 24 h. Cells were then rinsed and incubated with 0.5 𝛍 M LysoTracker Red (Thermo, catalog no. L7528) prior to fixation to stain acidified lysosomes. Cells were imaged on an ImageXpress Micro XLS high-content microscope (Molecular Devices) at × 40 objective obtaining four sites per well. 𝛃 -Gal activity was also detected in situ following cellular uptake of rh 𝛃 -gal using X-gal substrate, according to the manufacturer's kit protocol (Cell Signaling Technology, catalog no. 9860) with the X-gal staining solution being adjusted to pH 4.5 for detection of 𝛃 -gal specifically in lysosomes. Stained cells were imaged on the ImageXpress microscope at × 40 objective using transmitted light.\n\nFigure 8.

A , endogenousmutant 𝛃 -gal in GM1 gangliosidosis cells is prone to retention in the ER, which coincides with up-regulation of an unfolded protein response (18). B , GLB1 overexpression in feline GM1 gangliosidosis fibroblasts has previously been reported to promote mislocalization of the overexpressed WT 𝛃 -gal, with the majority of enzyme being retained in the ER (18). In our hands, chronic GLB1 overexpression in GM1 patientcells coincides with partial retention of rh 𝛃 -gal in a prelysosomal compartment,presumablyatneutralpH(Fig.8).Ourresults,alongwiththoseofMartin et al. (18), suggest that accumulation of precursor, nonlysosomal rh 𝛃 -gal in the ER activates the unfolded protein response and triggers ER stress, suggestive of irreversible damage caused by a prolonged UPR. However, detection of the mature lysosomal form of rh 𝛃 -gal by Western blotting in gene therapy-treated patient cells (Fig. 8) coincides with substrate clearance for several weeks (Fig. 7), suggesting that a pool of overexpressed 𝛃 -gal is reaching acidified lysosomes, where the enzyme likely resides as a stable dimer. In support of these findings, our in vitro biophysical studies suggest that rh 𝛃 -gal at low concentrations is predominantlyamonomerandpronetodestabilizationatneutralpH,whereasatacidicpH,theenzymeisastabledimer,independentofitsconcentration(Fig. 6). C , intermittent ERT with rh 𝛃 -gal results in direct and precise delivery of enzyme to acidified lysosomes, where the enzyme resides as a stable long-lived dimer, with a half-life of 9 days, which coincides with substrate clearance in patient cells (Figs. 1 and 7) and in the brain tissue of a mouse model of GM1 gangliosidosis (Fig. 3), without negatively impacting the ER (Figs. 2 and 8). CI-MPR-mediated endocytosis of rh 𝛃 -gal from the cell surface is dose-dependent and saturable, with very low-nanomolar doses of enzyme being sufficient to normalize 𝛃 -gal levels (Fig. 1). Once the rh 𝛃 -gal cellular uptake capacity in lysosomes is reached in cells of the brain, the remaining extracellular ICV administered rh 𝛃 -gal is presumably cleared by CSF exchange, which occurs several times per day (27). In support of this, we observe normalization of 𝛃 -gal activity levels in liver and bone marrow of ICV-ERT-treated KO mice (Fig. 5), suggestive of systemic exposure to the enzyme.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Substrate detection in patient cells by GM1 immunostaining and high-content imaging\n\nTotest substrate accumulation in GM05653 patient cells, we used a commercially available GM1 antibody for immunostaining. Briefly, GM05653 cells were grown for 7-10 days to permit substrate accumulation and then fixed (4% paraformal- dehyde in PBS) and permeabilized using normal goat serum (Thermo, catalog no. 50062Z) with 0.01% Triton X-100. Cells were then blocked in normal goat serum and then stained with an anti-GM1 antibody (Abcam, catalog no. ab23943, diluted 1:250 in normal goat serum) overnight at 4 °C. Cells were imaged on an ImageXpress high-content microscope as\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evaluation of 𝛃 -gal ERT and gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis\n\ndescribed previously. Granular immunostaining with antiGM1 antibody was quantified using a granularity algorithm within MetaMorph software. GM1 granularity was calculated as total granule area multiplied by average granule intensity divided by the number of cells and expressed as arbitrary units.\n\n## Substrate detection in GM1 gangliosidosis patient cells by glycan profiling\n\nCell extracts from GM1 gangliosidosis human patient fibroblast cell lines were found to accumulate two distinct classes of substrates in lysosomes after extended culture times due to the absence of lysosomal 𝛃 -gal activity: GM1 gangliosides and oligosaccharides (glycans) arising from cellular glycoprotein turnover. Profiling glycans derived from GM1 gangliosides require releasing oligosaccharides enzymatically from the lipid backbone using the endoglycosidase ceramide glycanase, followed by a precapillary derivatization with a charged fluorophore. This labeling reaction occurs through reductive amination, a reaction of the amino group of the fluorophore dye and aldehyde of the reducing termini generated on the released GM1 glycan. In this protocol, other oligosaccharides with reducing termini resulting from the incomplete digest of cellular glycoproteins in the lysosome were also labeled. Once labeled, the oligosaccharides were separated by CZE and detected by laser-induced fluorescence.\n\nAlternatively, assaying only a subset of oligosaccharide structures is done by directly labeling the 𝛃 -gal-deficient cell extracts and omitting the ceramide glycanase endoglycosidase treatment ( i.e. assay of glycans that resulted from incomplete digest of cellular glycoproteins). Glycan structures were determined in three ways: 1) by direct comparison with HILIC-MS-identified oligosaccharides and migration position by CE, 2) by exo-glycosidase digestion of peaks to observe expected shifts in migration times, and 3) by co-migrating glycan standards.\n\nCell extracts were prepared as follows. Internal CZE standard (3 -sialyl-′ N -acetyllactosamine, Glyco AD-01014; molecular weight 656.2) was reconstituted to 1 mg\/ml in sterile water to obtain a 1.5 mM solution. 50𝛍 l aliquots were prepared and stored at -20 °C. In preparation of samples for CZE, 3 -sy-′ alillactosamine standard was diluted 1:100 in mammalian protein extraction reagent solution. Cells were lysed with 3 -sy-′ alillactosamine mammalian protein extraction reagent solution. 25 𝛍 l of each cell extract was digested with 3 𝛍 l of ceramide glycanase (QA-bio, catalog no. LZ-CER-HM) overnight at 37 °C. The reactions were then dried in a SpeedVac. The recovered oligosaccharides were derivatized by reductive amination with 2 𝛍 l of 50 mM 8-aminopyrene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid (APTS, Sciex, catalog no. 501309) and 7 𝛍 l of 1 M sodium cyanoborohydride (Sigma, catalog no. 296813), followed by a vigorous mixing and incubation at 37 °C overnight. The following day, the oligosaccharides were resuspended in 10 𝛍 l of water followed by another vigorous mixing. Excess APTS dye was removedfromthelabelingmixturebypackingalow-speedSephadex G10 gel column (GE Healthcare, catalog no. 17-0010-01) followed by the addition of the glycan-labeling reaction and then spun for 3 min at 1000 rpm in a bucket centrifuge and recovery of glycans in the eluate. CZE was performed on the\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nCESI 8000 Plus (Sciex) using laser-induced fluorescence. The laser excitation wavelength was 488 nm. A 65-cm N-CAPcoated capillary with a 50𝛍 m inner diameter was used along with a Sciex kit-supplied N-CAP buffer (Sciex, catalog no. 477600). The capillary was pre-rinsed with buffer at 40 p.s.i. for 1 min. A 'water pillow' was injected at 0.5 p.s.i. for 20 s, followed by sample injections at 0.8 p.s.i. for 5.0 s. A second water pillow was injected at 0.1 p.s.i. for 10 s following the sample loading. Separation voltage was set to 21 kV for 20 min. The capillary temperature was set to 25 °C. The raw data were processed using 32 Karat software.\n\n## Evaluation of the ER system following 𝛃 -gal augmentation in patient fibroblasts\n\nLV-CMV-GLB1andLV-CMV-GFPplasmidsweredesigned, constructed, and used for large-scale production and ultrapurification of lentivirus particles by VectorBuilder (Santa Clara, CA). Virus was stored in 100𝛍 l aliquots at -80 °C, with a titer of 10 9 transduction units\/ml, as determined by VectorBuilder. Patient fibroblasts were plated into 96-well plates at 12,500 cells\/well and transduced with lentivirus in the presence of 0.5 𝛍 g\/ml Polybrene at varying multiplicity of infection (MOI). Alternatively, patient cells were incubated with rh 𝛃 -gal at varying concentrations. Following 24 h of virus transduction or cellular uptake with enzyme, cells were washed several times and then assayed for 𝛃 -gal activity (day 1). Alternatively, cells were chased in growth medium for up to 28 days, with 𝛃 -gal activity assayed in duplicate plates at day 7 and day 28.\n\nAt day 8, cells were lysed using mammalian protein extraction reagent and analyzed by Western blotting for 𝛃 -gal protein levels using 𝛃 -galactosidase antibody (Novus, catalog no. NBP2-45731) or Grp78 BiP antibody (Abcam, catalog no. MA1-250).\n\nCHOP distribution was analyzed at day 10 by immunofluorescence using a CHOP mAb (9C8; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Stained cells were analyzed by high-content imaging using the ImageXpress. In each well, four individual images were acquired at × 40 magnification. Images were acquired in the red (CHOP) and blue (nuclei) channels, and the number of nuclei was recorded as an indicator of cell viability. The nuclei in the blue channel were masked and used for analyzing the extent of CHOPtranslocation from the cytosol to the nucleus in the red channel. The nuclei that co-localized with endogenous CHOP were scored as translocation events and expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells imaged in each field. Tunicamycin (2.5 𝛍 g\/ml), a known inducer of CHOP translocation (22), was used as a positive control for ER stress.\n\n## Animals and ICV cannula implantation\n\nThe GLB1 null mouse (GLB1 KO) was generated as described by Hahn et al. (21). Founder mice were transferred from St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (Memphis, TN) to the Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) for re-derivation prior to importation to the BioMarin vivarium at the Buck Institute for Research and Aging (Novato, CA). Mice for this study were bred in-house from these re-derived animals. GLB1 KO mice were generated by mating heterozygous female (GLB1 + -\/ ) mice with male GLB1 - -\/ mice. C57BL\/6J mice\n\n## Evaluation of 𝛃 -gal ERT and gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis\n\nwere bred for use as WT controls. The studies conducted herein were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Buck Institute. Briefly, a permanent cannula was surgically placed into the left lateral ventricle of the brain of each mouse 5 days prior to the initiation of each study. ICV infusions (5𝛍 l total volume over a period of 15 min) were administered via the implanted cannula to deliver either rh 𝛃 -gal (100 𝛍 g) or vehicle (aCSF; 1 mM Na PO \/NaH PO4, 2 4 2 148 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, pH 7.1). For biodistribution and efficacy studies, brains were bisected along the superior sagittal sinus. The left hemisphere (ipsilateral to the infusion site) was processed for biochemical analysis. The right hemisphere (contralateral to the infusion site) was fixed in 10% paraformaldehyde for 24 h prior to processing for formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sectioning. Additional brains were also frozen for a histology-based frozen tissue 𝛃 -gal activity assay.\n\n## Animal experimental design\n\nToevaluate how early GLB1 KO mice bred at BioMarin begin to indicate detectable levels of neuropathology, brains from untreated WT or GM1 mice at 8 weeks of age were collected for subsequent analysis ( n = 3-4). This is the earliest time that ICV infusions are approved for use in mice. To ensure the detection and localization of 𝛃 -gal in treated mice, brains from 16-weekold WT and GM1 mice given a single, unilateral infusion of 𝛃 -gal or vehicle ( n = 3) were collected at 3 h post-treatment for MSanalysis of 𝛃 -gal protein levels. Additional brains were harvested at 3, 24, and 48 h to evaluate 𝛃 -gal activity in situ using X-gal substrate (see below). To evaluate efficacy of ICV-ERT, two study designs were implemented. First, GM1 mice were treated twice a week starting at 8 weeks of age for 2 weeks with a single 100𝛍 g infusion of 𝛃 -gal until 10 weeks of age (2-week PoC; four doses total; shorter, more frequent exposure to enzyme) with the left and right hemispheres being used for 𝛃 -gal activity, ganglioside, and glycan measurements. Second, GM1micewere treated once a week starting at 12 weeks of age with a single infusion of 𝛃 -gal until 20 weeks of age (8-week PoC; eight doses total; longer, less frequent exposure to enzyme), with only the left hemisphere being used for 𝛃 -gal, ganglioside, and glycan measurements and the right hemisphere being fixed and used for histology (see below). Brains were collected 24 h after the last infusion and processed for downstream analysis.\n\n## Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining of brain tissue\n\nBrain tissues were immersion-fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. For the majority of the IHC analyses, 7𝛍 mthick sagittal sections were taken at approximately the superior sagittal sinus (sagittal midline) delineating the left and right brain hemispheres. Region matching for the sagittal sections was conducted utilizing the lateral ventricle, hippocampus, thalamus, pons (pontine reticular nucleus), and the VIa lobule of the central cerebellar region, corresponding to position 164 of the mouse Allen Brain Atlas. For the biodistribution analysis, additional studies utilizing 7𝛍 mcoronalsections were taken at approximately the injection site (left hemisphere lateral ventri- cle). Region matching for the coronal sections was conducted using the lateral ventricles as a reference point, corresponding to position 218 of the mouse Allen Brain Atlas. Sections were immunostained with antibodies against LAMP2 (Abcam, 25339, 1:500), GFAP (Sigma, g9269, 1:4000) or IBA1 (Millipore, MABN92,1:250).Forantigenretrieval, slides were immersed in Discovery CC1 solution (Ventana, catalog no. 950-500) for 30 min at 95 °C. The blocking buffer consisted of a 2% NDS, 0.1% BSA, and 0.3% Triton solution in 1 × TBS. Donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-21206, 1-250) was used to detect anti-GFAP antibody. Anti-LAMP2 antibody was detected by a Donkey anti-mouse IgG (H + L) highly cross-adsorbed secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 555 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-31570, 1-500). Trisbuffered saline was used for all washes. Chromogenic staining of LAMP2 was performed due to observed high nonspecific signal when utilizing fluorescence-based immunohistochemistry. The principal methodology was comparable with fluorescence IHC. In addition, peroxide block (Bloxall, Vector Laboratories) was utilized to reduce endogenous peroxidase activity. The IMPRESS Rat polymer detection kit for chromogenic IHC was utilized to resolve the 3,3 -diaminobenzidine-labeled ′ LAMP2signal (Vector Laboratories). After staining, whole sections were scanned on a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1 using a × 20 Plan-Apo objective (Zeiss). Regions of interest include the cerebral cortex (somatomotor areas 2, 3, 5, and 6A), hippocampus, thalamus, and the pons (pontine reticular nucleus). Representative confocal images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope with an HC PL APO × 40\/1.30 or × 63\/1.4 oil objective and 1-airy unit pinhole diameter (Leica Microsystems).\n\n## Measurement of 𝛃 -gal activity in situ in frozen tissue sections\n\nTo evaluate region-specific development of 𝛃 -gal detection after a single infusion, the ipsilateral hemispheres of sagittal bisected brains were collected 24 h after infusion, frozen at -80 °C, and embedded in OCT for frozen sectioning. Brains were sectioned at 15 𝛍 monto Superfrost Plus slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and fixed in 0.25% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 15 min. The slides were then rinsed in PBS and utilized in an X-gal-based substrate staining kit (Senescence 𝛃 -galactosidase staining kit, Cell Signaling, catalog no. 9860). The manufacturer's suggested protocol was utilized with slight modifications. The pH of the staining solution was adjusted to 4.5 with the volumes proportionally normalized for the size of mouse sagittal brain sections. After signal development, whole sections were scanned as before, with similar regions of interest extracted for sagittal sections. Signal isolation and analysis was conducted via Photoshop (Adobe) and ImageJ. For both fluorescence and chromogenic-based IHC, the percentage of area of the total adjusted signal was utilized for downstream analysis. All data were analyzed via GraphPad Prism. Analysis of variance with Tukey post hoc testing was utilized to analyze the variance between each of the treatment groups. p &lt; 0.05 was determined to be statistically significant.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Evaluation of 𝛃 -gal ERT and gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis\n\n## Detection and quantification of human 𝛃 -gal in mouse brain homogenate using LC-parallel reaction monitoring (PRM)based targeted MS\n\nAll solvents were HPLC-grade from Sigma-Aldrich, and all chemicals where not stated otherwise were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Mouse left and right brain hemispheres were each dissected into the following regions: olfactory bulb (OFB), cerebral cortex (CBX), hypothalamus and septum (HS), cerebellum (CB) and mid-brain (MB, containing pons and medulla) and frozen individually. Frozen tissue samples were transferred to homogenization tubes preloaded with zirconium oxide beads (REDE-RNA, Next Advance), and a different volume of cold HPLC-grade water (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each sample (150 𝛍 l for CB, 90 𝛍 l for OFB, 360 𝛍 l for HS, 240 𝛍 l for MB, 480 𝛍 l for CBX). Samples were homogenized with a Bullet Blender (Next Advance) in a cold room (4 °C). Subsequently, 4 parts of Biognosys lysis buffer (Zurich, Switzerland) were added to 1 part of brain water homogenate. The protein concentration of all samples was determined using a BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The samples were then shipped to Biognosys (Zurich, Switzerland) for LC-PRM MS analysis. Samples were reduced using Biognosys' Reduction and Alkylation solution and digested overnight with sequencing grade modified trypsin (Promega) at a protein\/protease ratio of 50:1. The digested peptides were cleaned up for MS using C18 MacroSpin columns (SMM SS18V, TheNestGroup) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cleaned up peptides were dried down using a SpeedVac system and redissolved in LC solvent A (1% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid (FA)) containing iRT-peptide mix (Biognosys) for retention time calibration. Peptide concentration was measured at 280 nm with a SPECTROstar \/H23041 Nano spectrophotometer (BMG Labtech). Custom stable isotope-labeled reference peptides (Maxi SpikeTides T -M\\_QL\\_AAA, ± 10% quantification precision, &gt; 95% purity) were obtained from JPT (Berlin, Germany): AYVAVDGIPQGVLER, TEAVASSLYDILAR, and TVGAALDILCPSGPIK. For the absolute quantification of human 𝛃 -gal, the equimolar pool of the three peptides was used and added to the final peptide samples at known concentration as internal standards.\n\nFor the quantification of human 𝛃 -gal peptides by LC-PRM (1 𝛍 g\/sample), samples were injected to an in-house packed C18 column (ReproSil-Pur120C18AQ, 1.9 𝛍 m, 120-Å pore size; 75𝛍 minner diameter, 50-cm length, New Objective) on a ThermoScientific Easy nLC 1200 nano-LC system. LC solvents were as follows: A, 1% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% FA; B, 15% water in acetonitrile with 0.1% FA. The LC gradient was 5-40% solvent B in 50 min followed by 40-90% B in 2 min and 90% B for 12 min (total gradient length was 64 min). LC-PRM runs for peptide quantification were carried out on a Thermo Scientific QExactive mass spectrometer equipped with a standard nanoelectrospray source. Collision energies were 25 eV according to the vendor's specifications.\n\nAn unscheduled run in PRM mode was performed before data acquisition for retention time calibration using Biognosys' iRT concept as described (37). The acquisition window was 4 min. Signal processing and data analysis were carried out using\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nSpectroDive TM 7.0 (Biognosys), based on mProphet (38). A Q -value filter of 1% was applied. The absolute quantification was determined by comparing the abundance of the known internal standard peptides with the endogenous peptides. The ratio of the areas under the curve (between the endogenous and reference peptide) was used to determine the absolute levels of human 𝛃 -gal in the samples. Results were recalculated for fmol of human 𝛃 -gal (using the molecular mass of 76,000 Da from the UniProt database) per mg of tissue.\n\n## Assays of 𝛃 -gal enzyme activity in tissues\n\nFrozen tissue samples ( ∼ 200 mg of liver tissue or brain hemispheres weighing 150-300 mg each) were transferred to homogenization tubes preloaded with zirconium oxide beads (REDE-RNA, Next Advance), and 600 𝛍 l of cold HPLC-grade water (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to each sample. Samples were homogenized with a Bullet Blender (Next Advance) in a cold room set to 4 °C. An aliquot (300 𝛍 l) of this homogenate was removedforganglioside and glycan analysis and neuraminidase activity measurements. The remaining tissue homogenate in the lysing tubes was homogenized again after the addition of 420 𝛍 l of chilled T-Per buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with protease inhibitor mixture (Thermo Fisher Scientific). This homogenate was transferred to a new tube containing an additional 300 𝛍 l of T-Per with protease inhibitors. The T-Per homogenate samples were centrifuged in a refrigerated tabletop centrifuge (Eppendorf) for 15 min at maximum speed (14,000 rpm), and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and used for 𝛃 -gal activity assays and Western blotting.\n\nTo measure 𝛃 -gal activity in tissues, T-Per protein extracts were diluted to 4 𝛍 g\/ 𝛍 l by the addition of dilution buffer (5 mM NaPO4, 0.005% Tween 80, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% BSA, pH 6.5). 𝛃 -Gal activity was measured in duplicate by incubating 5 𝛍 l of T-Per tissue protein extract (containing 20 𝛍 g of protein\/well) with 1.8 mM 4MU-GAL (Sigma-Aldrich, catalog no. M1633) in assay buffer (50 mM citrate, 125 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% BSA, pH 4.5) at 37 °C in a black 96-well plate (Corning). After 30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 200 𝛍 l of stop buffer (0.5 M glycine, 0.3 M NaOH, pH 10.3) to each well, and fluorescence was measured on a FlexStation 3 multimode microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) with excitation wavelength at 355 nm and emission wavelength at 460 nm. The fluorogenic compound 4MU emits light when free in solution but not when covalently bound to a synthetic substrate.\n\nRaw data were acquired using SoftMax Pro 6.3 (Molecular Devices) and transferred to Excel spreadsheets (Excel 2007, Microsoft Corp.) for analysis. The activity levels of the samples were calculated by extrapolating the amount of product (4MU) generated in the reaction from a seven-point standard curve that was prepared by adding a known amount of 4MU (SigmaAldrich, catalog no. M1381) into 20 𝛍 g\/well of GM1 KO brain or liver protein extract used as background matrix. Activity levels are expressed as nmol of 4MU cleaved\/mg of protein\/h. The amount of active human 𝛃 -gal in tissue homogenate samples from ICV treated GM1 KO mice was back-calculated from a seven-point standard curve that was prepared by adding a known amount of recombinant human 𝛃 -gal (BioMarin Phar-\n\n## Evaluation of 𝛃 -gal ERT and gene therapy for GM1 gangliosidosis\n\nmaceutical Inc.) into 20 𝛍 g\/well GM1 KO brain or liver protein extract used as matrix.\n\nof the glycan substrates accumulating in GM1 gangliosidosis mice has recently been reported (4).\n\nAnalyzed data were entered into Prism 7 (GraphPad) to prepare the graphs used in the figures. Statistical analysis (one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple-comparison test) was performed using Prism 7.\n\n## Ganglioside and glycan analysis in mouse tissues\n\nTissue samples (homogenized in water) were analyzed for GM1andGA1levels with an Acquity UPLC attached to a Xevo TQ-S micro triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters). Gangliosides were separated on an Acquity UPLC Glycan BEH Amide column (Waters). Samples were ionized by ESI in positive ion mode. The capillary voltage was set at 1.0 kV, the desolvation temperature was set at 500 °C, and the desolvation gas flow was 1000 liters\/h. Two precursor-product ion transitions, one for the (d18:1\/18:0) species and one for the (d18:1\/20:0) species, were monitored for each of the five gangliosides. The sum of the two transitions for each ganglioside was used for quantitation. A standard reference curve containing all five gangliosides from 100 to 6.25 pg\/ 𝛍 l was prepared with standards from Enzo Life Sciences, Inc. (Farmingdale, NY) in 95:5 methanol\/glacial acetic acid (v\/v).\n\nTheA2G2(NA2)glycan(2000pmol)wasdigestedwithEndo S (800 units) (New England Biolabs) in a total volume of 20 𝛍 l of 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, for 18-24 h, followed by purification on a Sep-PAK C18 SPE cartridge (100 mg, 1 ml) (Waters), as per the manufacturer's instructions, and dried by centrifugal evaporation. Dried A2G2 ′ glycan standard was then labeled with [ 13 C6]aniline (15 𝛍 l of 1 M NaCNBH3 in 70:30 DMSO\/HOAc)at37 °C for 18-24 h, and the remaining aniline was removed by centrifugal evaporation.\n\nLC\/MS analysis of samples for glycans was performed on an Acquity UPLC system equipped with a Glycan BEH Amide HILIC column (1.7 𝛍 m, 2.1 × 150 mm) (Waters) connected to a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). Solvent A was 100 mM ammonium formate, pH 4.5, and solvent B was acetonitrile with an initial composition of 22% A, 78% B and a flow rate of 0.2 ml\/min. The column temperature was kept at 60 °C. Prior to injection, an amount of aniline-labeled sample equal to 70 𝛍 g of protein was placed in an LC\/MS sample vial along with 10 pmol of [ 13 C6]aniline-labeled A2G2 ′ biomarker internal standard and dried by centrifugal evaporation. The samples were then dissolved in a solution of 22% A, 78% B. The labeled free glycans were eluted using a gradient profile of 22% A, 78% B to 37% A; 63%Bover65min;100%A,0%Bfor6min;100%A,0%Bto22% A, 78% B in 5 min; and held there for 9 min. The LTQ Orbitrap XL was operated in the positive ion mode, and the sample was introduced by ESI. The capillary temperature was set at 250 °C with a capillary voltage of 2 kV. The sheath gas flow was set to 58, and the auxiliary gas flow was set to 9. Full scans were performed at a resolution of 60,000 and a range of 200-2250 m z \/ . The N -glycan A2G2 ′ metabolite was determined by ratiometric comparisonofthe[ 12 C6]aniline-labeled endogenous A2G2 ′ ion abundancewiththatoftheknownmolaramountoftheinternal standard spike as described previously. 4 Afull characterization\n\nAuthor contributions -J.

The BCL2 selective inhibitor venetoclax has potent anti-leukemia efficacy; however, resistance can occur due to its inability to inhibit MCL1, which is stabilized by the MAPK pathway. In this study, we aimed to determine the anti-leukemia efficacy of concomitant targeting of the BCL2 and MAPK pathways by venetoclax and the MEK1\/2 inhibitor cobimetinib, respectively. The combination demonstrated synergy in seven of 11 AML cell lines, including those resistant to single agents, and showed growth-inhibitory activity in over 60% of primary samples from patients  with  diverse  genetic  alterations.  The  combination  markedly impaired leukemia progenitor functions, while maintaining normal progenitors.  Mass  cytometry  data  revealed  that  BCL2  protein  is  enriched  in leukemia stem\/progenitor cells, primarily  in  venetoclax-sensitive  samples, and that cobimetinib suppressed cytokine-induced pERK and pS6 signaling pathways. Through proteomic profiling studies, we identified several pathways inhibited downstream of MAPK that contribute to the synergy of the combination. In OCI-AML3 cells, the combination downregulated MCL1 protein  levels  and  disrupted  both  BCL2:BIM  and  MCL1:BIM  complexes, releasing  BIM  to  induce  cell  death.  RNA  sequencing  identified  several enriched pathways, including MYC, mTORC1, and p53 in cells sensitive to the  drug  combination. In  vivo , the  venetoclax-cobimetinib  combination reduced leukemia burden in xenograft models using genetically engineered OCI-AML3 and MOLM13 cells. Our data thus provide a rationale for combinatorial blockade of MEK and BCL2 pathways in AML.\n\n## Introduction\n\nAcute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation and arrested differentiation of abnormal stem and progenitor cells. Standard induction chemotherapy induces a high rate of complete remission but fails to improve overall survival especially in elderly patients with AML. 1,2 Genes significantly mutated in AML can be organized into several functional categories that are associated with enhanced proliferation, impaired differentiation, deregulated chromatin modification, and DNA methylation. 1,3 Therefore,  co-targeting  downstream  pathways  that  contribute  to\n\n<!-- image -->\n\n## Haematologica 2020\n\nVolume 105(3):697-707\n\n## Correspondence:\n\nReceived: August 28, 2018.\n\nAccepted: May 22, 2019.\n\nPre-published: May 23, 2019.\n\nMARINA KONOPLEVA mkonople@mdanderson.org\n\ndoi:10.3324\/haematol.2018.205534\n\nCheck the online version for the most updated information on this article, online supplements, and information on authorship &amp; disclosures: www.haematologica.org\/content\/105\/3\/697\n\n## ©2020 Ferrata Storti Foundation\n\nMaterial published in Haematologica is covered by copyright.

BCL2 is highly expressed in AML leukemia stem cells (LSC) containing low levels of reactive oxygen species which are resistant to chemotherapy. 4,5 BCL2 inhibitors have been shown to eradicate AML LSC and sensitize chronic myeloid  leukemia  LSC  to  tyrosine  kinase  inhibitors. Oncogenic  dependency  on  BCL2  was  found  in  AML patients carrying mutations in IDH1 and IDH2. 6,7 A recent study used BH3 profiling to discover that co-inhibition of BCL2 with tyrosine kinase inhibitors facilitated eradication of  genetically  diverse  AML  in  patient-derived  xenograft (PDX) models. We have reported the anti-leukemia potency 8 of venetoclax (ABT-199\/GDC-0199), an orally bioavailable BH3  mimetic  that  selectively  binds  with  high  affinity  to BCL2,  but  lacks  affinity  for  BCL-XL  and  MCL1,  in  AML models. 9 In a phase II clinical trial, venetoclax monotherapy had clinical activity in patients with relapsed or refractory AML with a tolerable safety profile. 10 However, the inability of venetoclax to inhibit MCL1 causes resistance in leukemia cells that require MCL1 for survival. 11,12\n\nThe  RAF\/MEK\/ERK  (MAPK)  cascade,  a  major  effector pathway activated in 70%-80% of patients with AML, is activated by upstream mutant proteins such as FLT3, KIT, and  RAS. 13-15 The  MAPK  pathway  regulates  BCL2  family proteins  by  stabilizing  anti-apoptotic  MCL1 11,16 and inactivating pro-apoptotic BIM (BCL2L11). 17 Monotherapy with MEK inhibitors has had limited clinical efficacy. 15 Recently it was shown that MAPK signaling activation contributed to primary resistance to an IDH2 inhibitor 18 and acquired resistance to venetoclax, 19 suggesting that combination regimens that  include  MEK  inhibitors  could  be  efficacious  in  these patients.  Cobimetinib  (GDC-0973)  is  an  allosteric  MEK inhibitor  with  antitumor  activity  in  BRAF-  and  KRASmutant  tumor  cells, 20 and  was  recently  approved  to  treat patients with metastatic melanoma. Its anti-AML efficacy, particularly in combination with venetoclax, is unknown.\n\nFurthermore,  biomarkers  predictive  of  response  to  this combination in AML are unknown. Suppression of downstream  pERK  does  not  predict  sensitivity  to  MEK  inhibition. 21 In melanoma,  it  has  been  demonstrated  that mTORC1\/2 and pS6 activities are associated with acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors and suppression of pS6 may serve  as  a  biomarker  to  predict  clinical  response  to  MEK inhibitors. 22,23 The role of pS6 in response to MEK and BCL2 inhibition has not been addressed.\n\nIn  this  study,  we  evaluated  the  anti-leukemia  effects  of concomitant BCL2 and MAPK blockade by venetoclax and cobimetinib in AML cell lines, primary patients' samples, and xenograft murine models. Through the use of reverse-phase protein  arrays  (RPPA)  and  RNA  sequencing,  we  identified pharmacodynamic markers that correlated with the efficacy of  the  combination  treatment,  in  particular  activated  pS6 (Ser235\/236),  which  discriminated  combination-sensitive from -insensitive AML cells. Our data support the rationale for dual inhibition of the BCL2 and MEK pathways.\n\n## Methods\n\n## Patients' samples, acute myeloid leukemia cell lines, and reagents\n\nBone marrow and peripheral blood samples were collected from patients with AML or healthy donors after informed con- sent  had  been  obtained  in  accordance  with  the  Institutional Review Board of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.  The  cell  line  culture  methodology  is  described  in  the Online Supplementary Methods .\n\n## Assays and other methods\n\nDetails of the CellTiter-Glo proliferation assay, colony-forming cell assay, electrochemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, RPPA, and RNA sequencing are provided in the Online Supplementary Methods . Antibody conjugation for mass  cytometry  staining  and  the  spanning-tree  progression analysis of density-normalized events (SPADE) analysis are also explained in detail in the Online Supplementary Methods .\n\n## Apoptosis in primary acute myeloid leukemia samples\n\nAs previously reported, 24 18 primary AML peripheral blood mononuclear cells or AML PDX samples were cultured in LSC medium. Viable AML CD45 dim blast cells were enumerated by using  CountBright  counting  beads  (Cat.  C36950;  Invitrogen, Carlsbad,  CA,  USA)  with  concurrent  annexin  V  and  DAPI detection  on  a  Gallios  Flow  Cytometer  (Beckman  Coulter, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Data analysis and additional details are included in the Online Supplementary Methods .\n\n## In vivo study of cobimetinib and venetoclax in acute myeloid leukemia xenograft mouse models\n\nThe  animal  studies  were  performed  in  accordance  with guidelines approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at MD Anderson. Nonobese diabetic\/severe combined  immunodeficient  gamma  IL3-GM-SF  (NSG-SGM3  or NSGS)  mice  (female,  8-10  weeks  old)  were  purchased  from Jackson  Laboratory  (Bar  Harbor,  ME,  USA).  The  mice  were injected  intravenously  with  OCI-AML3-Luci-GFP  (1.0×10 ) 6 cells, which were lentivirally transduced with firefly luciferase. Leukemia  engraftment  was  confirmed  1  week  after  injection through  a  noninvasive in  vivo bioluminescence  imaging  (BLI) system (Xenogen, Alameda, CA, USA) after injection of a Dluciferin  (4  mg\/mouse)  substrate.  Mice  were  distributed  into four  groups  (11  mice\/group)  with  comparable  tumor  burden and  dosed  daily  for  4  weeks  with  one  of  the  following  oral preparations: vehicle, cobimetinib (10 mg\/kg), venetoclax (100 mg\/kg),  or  cobimetinib  plus  venetoclax.  BLI  was  performed weekly to determine the extent of engraftment. Survival was monitored  as  an  endpoint.  A  similar  MOLM13  model  is described in the Online Supplementary Methods .\n\n## Statistical analyses\n\nThe Student  -test was used to analyze the statistical signifit cance of differences between groups, both in vitro and in vivo . All statistical tests were two-sided, and the results are expressed as the mean ± standard deviation. A P value ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically  significant.  The  RPPA  and  RNA-sequencing  data analysis are described in the Online Supplementary Methods .\n\n## Results\n\n## Cobimetinib and venetoclax demonstrate synergistic anti-leukemia efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines in vitro\n\nTo assess the anti-leukemia activity of cobimetinib and venetoclax as single agents or in combination, we studied their  effects  on  cell  proliferation  of  11  AML  cell  lines (Table 1). The median inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values of single agents were determined in a dose-response\n\nmanner  using  CellTiter-Glo  (CTG)  assays  after  72  h  of drug  treatment.  The  IC 50 values  of  cobimetinib  (range, 0.002 µ M - 3.0 µ M) did not correlate with either the status of RAS mutations or the basal levels of p-ERK1\/2 determined by flow cytometry (Table 1). To assess pharmacological interactions between cobimetinib and venetoclax, incremental doses were applied based on the IC 50 value of each drug. In seven of the 11 cell lines, combination of the agents elicited synergistic growth inhibition based on the Chou-Talalay method of analysis [combination index (CI) &lt;0.8]. 25 Cell lines with IC 50 values below the selected cutoff values (0.3 µ M for cobimetinib 20 and 0.1 µ M for venetoclax )  were  defined  as  sensitive  to  the  single  agent. 9 Patterns of response to single agents and the combination were  distinct.  Notably,  while  synergy  was  observed  in both  venetoclax-resistant  (MOLM14,  OCI-AML3,  NB4) and cobimetinib-resistant cell lines (KG1, MOLM13), the lowest CI value (0.12) was seen in venetoclaxsensitive\/cobimetinib-resistant AML cells (KG1) (Figure 1).\n\n## Cobimetinib and venetoclax demonstrate on-target suppression of cell proliferation and clonogenic potential of leukemia progenitors in a subset of primary acute myeloid leukemia cells ex vivo\n\nThe anti-leukemia activities of cobimetinib and venetoclax were examined in 18 primary samples with diverse genetic alterations, collected from patients with AML or spleen from PDX models (Table 2). Primary AML blasts were treated with cobimetinib and venetoclax alone or in combination at 0.1 µ M for 5 days in LSC medium to maintain the immature state of the leukemia cells. 24 Cobimetinib  alone  induced  minimal  cell  death  (specific apoptosis, 6.7 ± 5.9%), which was significantly enhanced when the drug was given in combination with venetoclax (27.7  ±  20.2%, P =0.001)  (Figure  2A,  left).  Cobimetinib inhibited cell proliferation in the majority of cases (34.2 ± 23.7%), and this suppression was more pronounced when the drug was combined with venetoclax (60.2 ± 28.8%, P &lt;0.001) (Figure  2A,  right).  Venetoclax  as  a  single  agent reduced  viable  cell  numbers  by  more  than  50%  in  six cases  (33.3%).  Three  of  the  four  AML  samples  demonstrating over 50% growth inhibition by the cobimetinib treatment carried the FLT3 -ITD and\/or D835 point mutation (AML 12, 13, and 17). As previously reported, IDH -mutant AML samples were highly sensitive to venetoclax as a single agent (AML 2 and 15). Over 60% (11 of 18) of the patients' samples responded to the combination treatment,  including  those  insensitive  to  either  compound alone (AML 1, 8 and 11). Importantly, induction of apoptosis in AML stem\/progenitor CD34 CD38 CD123 + -+ population following the combination treatment was observed in two out of four AML  samples  tested ( Online Supplementary  Figure  S1 ). The  clonogenic  potential  of myeloid progenitors was significantly suppressed by the combination (82.5 ± 20.0%), as compared to cobimetinib (38.3  ±  14.6%, P =0.01)  or  venetoclax  (41.9  ±  18.6%, P &lt;0.05) alone. Normal progenitor function was minimally affected (Figure 2B and Online Supplementary Figure S2 ).\n\nTo test the on-target efficacy of both agents, we developed a 28-parameter mass cytometry [time-of-flight mass spectrometry  (CyTOF)]  panel  comprising  antibodies against  surface  antigens  to  define  AML  stem\/progenitor fractions and intracellular proteins of the BCL2 family and various  signaling  pathways 26 ( Online  Supplementary  Table S1 ). The CyTOF study was performed in AML13 (sensitive to the combination) and AML14 (resistant to the combination) samples (Figure 2C). SPADE trees were built and annotated using all cell surface markers ( Online Supplementary Table S1 ); the positive markers were included in the heat maps ( Online Supplementary Figure S3 ). BCL2 protein  levels  were  significantly  enriched  in  CD34 + stem\/progenitor cells compared to CD34 -cells and BCL2 was expressed at a higher level in the venetoclax-sensitive sample (AML13) than in the venetoclax-resistant sample (AML14), consistent with our published data9 (Figure 2D). These results support the notion that venetoclax preferentially target LSC in AML. As previously reported, the cancer signaling network relies on the manner in which cancer cells respond to external stimuli rather than their basal phosphorylation state. 27 Therefore, following cobimetinib treatment, we stimulated primary AML cells with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) or stem cell factor (SCF) to study MEK downstream signaling pathways under conditions mimicking a cytokine-rich bone marrow\n\nTable 1.

The SPADE trees were colored based on  expression  levels  of  CD34.  In  AML13,  annotation  4 (6.5%  of  total  viable  cells)  represented  the  leukemia stem\/progenitor  cell  population  by  phenotypically  positive  expression  of  CD34,  CD123,  CD25,  CD135,  and CD64. Annotation 8 accounted for 53.4% of total viable cells in AML14, and was highly positive for expression of CD34,  CD123,  CD117,  CD135,  and  CD64  ( Online Supplementary  Figure  S3 ).  In  both  samples,  we  observed low basal levels of pERK, which increased following GCSF stimulation (3.9-fold in AML13 and 5.7-fold increase in  AML14).  G-CSF-stimulated  pERK  in  both  patients' samples was largely inhibited by cobimetinib despite differential responses in proliferation assays (Figure 2C, D), indicating that suppression of pERK does not predict sensitivity to MEK inhibition and is consistent with previous reports. 21 Several studies have shown that suppression of mTORC1 and downstream pathways (especially S6) pre- dicted  sensitivity  to  MEK  inhibition. 21,22 We  found  that pS6  was  highly  activated  by  SCF  and  effectively  suppressed by cobimetinib in the cobimetinib-sensitive AML sample, whereas the cobimetinib-resistant AML sample did not demonstrate a response to SCF. As in this study, we treated cells overnight and transiently stimulated then for 10 min to look into activation of signal transduction pathways  (Figure  2).  Due  to  limited  exposure  to  the inhibitors (2 h), we were unable to detect changes in frequencies of AML stem\/progenitor cells ( Online Supplementary Figure S4 ).\n\n## Transcriptomic and proteomic profiles identify pharmacodynamic markers underlying responses to targeted agents\n\nTo identify the pharmacodynamic markers underlying the observed drug responses, we treated the 11 AML cell lines (Table 1) with cobimetinib and venetoclax as single\n\nFigure 1. Anti-leukemia efficacy of cobimetinib and venetoclax in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. Eleven acute myeloid leukemia cell lines were left untreated or treated with cobimetinib or venetoclax as single agents at 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, or 1.0 µ M for 72 h. Calcusyn software was used to calculate the median inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values. Combinations of the two drugs were then tested on the same cell lines at dose ranges of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 times the IC 50 value of each compound. The combination index of each combination in each cell line was calculated on the basis on the luminescent intensity that correlated with number of viable cells determined by the CellTiter-Glo assay. Responses to treatment were categorized into four patterns: (i) sensitive to both drugs; (ii) sensitive only to cobimetinib and showing synergy for the combination; (iii) sensitive only to venetoclax and showing synergy for the combination; (iv) resistant to both drugs.

As already described, cells with IC 50 values &lt;0.3 µ M for cobimetinib or &lt;0.1 µ M for venetoclax were categorized as sensitive and those with IC 50 values above  these  cutoffs  were  considered  resistant.  For  the combination groups, CI values &lt;0.8 were considered synergistic.\n\nQuantification of 90 proteins by RPPA identified several biomarkers that correlated with in vitro drug responses. For example,  S6  phosphorylation  at  Ser235\/236  was  significantly  reduced  in  both  cobimetinib-sensitive  and  -resistant cell lines compared to untreated cells, with sensitive cells displaying higher basal phosphorylation at Ser235\/236. Significant pMEK induction was observed in cobimetinib-resistant cell lines (Figure 3A). Several signaling  pathways  were  highly  activated  under  basal  condi- tions in cobimetinib-sensitive cells compared to resistant cells, including pS6 (Ser235\/236), pRSK, pERK, p38MAPK and  pPTEN  ( Online  Supplementary  Figure  S5A ).  Proteins indicating responses to venetoclax treatment were largely limited to the caspase-dependent apoptotic cascade ( data not shown ). Higher levels of BAX and BCL2 and lower levels of BIM and pS6 (Ser240\/244) correlated with sensitivity to venetoclax ( Online Supplementary Figure S5B ). In cell lines in which cobimetinib and venetoclax had a synergistic effect, several MEK downstream pathways were significantly  downregulated  and  cleaved  poly  (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was detected, indicating induction of apoptosis (Figure 3B). These changes were not identified in cell lines in which a synergistic effect did not occur. The heat maps of the complete RPPA datasets are shown in Online Supplementary Figure S6 .\n\nWestern blotting was performed to validate the RPPA\n\nTable 2.

For 5-day culture assays,  all samples were collected from peripheral blood,  except AML #15,  which was from bone marrow ,  and AML #1,  #5,  and #9,  which were from patient-derived xenograft mouse spleens. All the samples for CFC assays were bone marrow .\n\nFigure 2. Treatment with cobimetinib and venetoclax causes on-target suppression of cell proliferation and impairs leukemia progenitor function in a subset of primary acute myeloid leukemia cases. (A) Primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) peripheral blood mononuclear or bone marrow cells from AML cases were cultured in serum-free expansion medium supplemented with BIT 9500 Serum Substitute and cytokines, including stem cell factor (SCF; 100 ng\/mL), Flt3 ligand (50 ng\/mL), interleukin 3 (IL3; 20 ng\/mL), and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF; 20 ng\/mL) as well as StemRegenin 1 (SR1; 1 µ M). Cells were left untreated or treated with cobimetinib (Cobi) or venetoclax (Van), both at 0.1 µ M, as single agents or in combination (Combo). After culture for 5 days, cells were stained with CD45-PE, Annexin-V-APC, and DAPI. Apoptotic leukemia blasts (CD45dimAnnexin-V ) were isolated by flow cytometry. Results are expressed as percentage of specific apoptosis + calculated by the formula: 100 × (% apoptosis of treated cells - % apoptosis of control cells)\/(100 - % apoptosis of control cells). Percentage of growth inhibition was calculated on the basis of the number of control viable cells (Annexin-V \/DAPI ). ** --P &lt;0.01; *** P &lt;0.001. (B) Mononuclear cells collected from AML patients (100,000 cells) or healthy donors (50,000 cells; NBM) were plated in methylcellulose, then treated with venetoclax or cobimetinib (both at 0.1 µ M) as single agents or in combination. Colonies were scored on day 14. Data are presented as percentage inhibition compared to control groups. (C) The absolute cell counts of AML13 and AML14 samples as determined in (A) are shown in comparison with those of untreated controls (Contr), with median inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values indicated for each sample. (D) AML13 and AML14 samples were treated with cobimetinib 1.0 µ M overnight followed by 10 min with or without (Unstim) stimulation with SCF or G-CSF (100 ng\/mL). Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and processed for time-of-lfight mass spectrometry. Spanning-tree progression analysis of density-normalized events (SPADE) trees were generated by using markers shown in Online Supplementary Figure S2 . The leukemia stem\/progenitor populations were manually annotated and highlighted by analysis of all surface markers. The median intensities of pERK and pS6 in gated populations are shown.

Pharmacodynamic markers of drug response identified through reverse-phase protein arrays and RNA sequencing. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines were left untreated or treated with cobimetinib or venetoclax as single agents or in combination at 0.5, 1, or 2 times the median inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of each compound in each cell line for 24 h. Cell pellets were harvested after treatment and subjected to reverse-phase protein array (RPPA) analysis as previously reported. (A) Plots depict proteins differentially expressed between cobimetinib-sensitive and cobimetinib-resistant cells. (B) The mean values of corresponding proteins in cell lines showing synergy to the combination treatment (CI&lt;0.8 as presented in Table 1) are shown in the heatmap. Only the proteins showing significant differences ( P &lt;0.05) between control and treated groups are shown. C: untreated control; T: treated; S: sensitive; R: resistant; Syn: synergy. (C) Cells were treated with cobimetinib (Cobi), venetoclax (Ven), or a combination (Combo) at 10, 100 and 1000 nM for 4 h and subjected to lysis; proteins were separated and probed with the antibodies indicated. (D) AML cell lines were left untreated (control) or treated with cobimetinib or venetoclax as single agents or in combination at 10 times the median inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value of each compound in each cell line for 4 h. Cell pellets were harvested after treatment and subjected to electrochemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of BCL2, MCL1, BCL2:BIM and MCL1:BIM complexes were plotted based on percentages of the levels in the control group. (E) AML cells were treated and processed as described above for the RPPA assay. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy kit and sent for mRNA sequencing. The enriched pathways in cell types showing synergy in response to the combination are shown.\n\ndata in four cell lines representing different response patterns (Table 1, Figure 3C and Online Supplementary Figure S5C ). Suppression of pERK by cobimetinib was observed in both sensitive (OCI-AML3 and MV4;11) and resistant (MOLM13  and  U937)  cells  at  0.01 µ M,  irrespective  of response  patterns.  pS6  (Ser235\/236  or  Ser240\/244)  was inhibited by a low dose (0.1 µ M) of cobimetinib in sensitive OCI-AML3 cells but not in resistant U937 cells (Figure 3C),  consistent  with  our  RPPA  findings  noted  above. These data also indicate direct suppression of mTORC1 signaling by cobimetinib as the Ser240\/244 site is regulated exclusively by mTORC1. MYC was downregulated by cobimetinib alone or in combination with venetoclax in OCI-AML3, but not in U937 cells. Cell death characterized by elevated levels of cleaved PARP was observed in the  combination  group  in  OCI-AML3  cells,  consistent with  pro-apoptotic  synergy  (Figure  3C).  To  capture  the dynamic  interactions  of  pro-  and  anti-apoptotic  BCL2 family members, a Meso Scale Discovery assay was performed in OCI-AML3 cells (Figure 3D). High basal levels of BCL2 and BCL2:BIM complexes were identified. After venetoclax treatment, BCL2:BIM complexes were disrupted and MCL1 protein levels were upregulated, resulting in increased  MCL1:BIM  complexes.  The  combination  of cobimetinib with venetoclax suppressed both BCL2:BIM and MCL1:BIM complexes, enabling release of free BIM to induce  cell  death  (Figure  3D).  In  addition,  cobimetinib treatment  induced  total  BIM  protein  levels  in  MV4;11 cells, thereby priming the cells for death ( Online Supplementary Figure S7 ).\n\nTo refine our search for potential biomarkers correlating with  response  to  the  venetoclax-cobimetinib  combination, we performed RNA sequencing and evaluated differential  gene  expression  after  exposure  to  the  drugs.  The aim was to identify hallmark cancer pathways significantly altered specifically in cells sensitive to the drug combination (Figure 3E and Online Supplementary Table S2 ). Our analysis  demonstrated  that  several  downstream  pathways, including  MYC, E2F and their target  genes,  were significantly altered after treatment in cells that responded synergistically to the combination. Consistent with western blot data, mTORC1 signaling was also altered in cells showing  synergistic  responses.  Hypoxia  and  unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways were also significantly enriched,  possibly  downstream  of  mTOR\/4EBP1\/eIF4E signaling, which directs protein synthesis of HIF-1 α , 28 and can trigger the UPR. 29 Glycolysis, another enriched pathway, is regulated by the ERK signaling pathway through RNK126-mediated ubiquitination of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, which may account for resistance to apoptosis. 30\n\n## The combination of cobimetinib and venetoclax reduces leukemia burden in acute myeloid leukemia models in vivo\n\nTo  test  the  efficacy  of  cobimetinib  and  venetoclax in vivo , we induced leukemia in NSGS mice by injecting the animals with genetically engineered OCI-AML3\/Luc\/GFP cells. Leukemia engraftment was confirmed 1 week after injection using BLI. Mice were randomly distributed into four arms and dosed orally with vehicle, cobimetinib (10 mg\/kg), venetoclax (100 mg\/kg), or cobimetnib plus venetoclax  daily  for  28  days.  BLI  demonstrated  that  the leukemia  burden  was  significantly  reduced  in  treated groups  compared  to  controls  over  time  (Figure  4A).  At week 5, the tumor reduction was significantly greater in the groups that received single-agent cobimetinib ( P &lt;0.001) or cobimetnib plus venetoclax ( P &lt;0.001) than in the control group (Figure 4B). The tumor reduction was greater  following  combination  treatment  than  following venetoclax  ( P &lt;0.05)  or  cobimetinib  ( P &lt;0.05)  alone.  All drug treatments, including combinations, were tolerated in vivo based on minimal changes in body weights ( data not shown ).\n\nAs a second AML cell line-derived xenograft model, we introduced genetically engineered MOLM3\/Luc\/GFP cells into NSGS mice and initiated treatment as for the OCIAML3\/Luc\/GFP model. Again, BLI demonstrated significantly  reduced  leukemia  burden  in  the  treated  groups compared  to  controls  and  the  reduction  was  more  pronounced in the groups treated with single-agent venetoclax  or  cobimetinib  plus  venetoclax  (Figure  4C,  D). Additionally, human CD45 engraftment and cell counts in both  bone  marrow  and  spleen  demonstrated  a  trend toward decreased tumor burden in mice treated with the drug combination compared to that in mice treated with either agent alone ( Online Supplementary Figure S8A, B ). As in  the  OCI-AML3\/Luc  xenograft  model,  all  drug  treatments were tolerated based on minimal changes in body weights.  We  performed  additional  PDX  studies  in  NSG mice using an AML PDX generated from primary sample AML11 (Table 2). The mice were treated with the same doses of drugs as those used in the cell line models. As shown in Online Supplementary Figure S9 , the combination therapy  extended  survival  in  the  AML11  PDX  model. These data demonstrate that the combination of cobimetinib plus venetoclax potently suppresses leukemia burden in tumor-bearing mice in vivo at tolerable doses.\n\n## Discussion\n\nAlthough  gain-of-function  mutations  often  represent secondary events in the pathogenesis of AML, 31,32 they are required for AML maintenance and are therefore attractive therapeutic  targets. 33 While  MEK  inhibitors  have demonstrated limited activity in AML as single agents, 15,34 preclinical  studies  with  first  generation  MEK  and  BCL2 inhibitors demonstrated synergistic induction of apoptosis by suppression of MCL1 following MEK inhibition. 11,35\n\nIn this study, five of the 11 AML cell lines tested were sensitive  to  cobimetinib,  including  two  that  harbored  a FLT3 -ITD mutation (MOLM14 and MV4;11) and one with an NRAS mutation (OCI-AML3). Consistent with previous  reports,  the  baseline  levels  of  ERK  phosphorylation did not  correlate with  response  to  cobimetinib. 21,36 Venetoclax as a single agent had activity in five of the cell lines tested while the combination with cobimetinib was synergistic in seven of the cell lines, including those that were resistant to each agent alone.\n\nTo extend our preliminary findings in cell lines, we studied  a  selection  of  genetically  diverse  primary  AML patients' samples. Venetoclax induced pronounced apoptosis (&gt;50%) in only three of the samples (16.7%), a rate similar to that of clinical responses  to venetoclax monotherapy (19%), 10 possibly reflecting protective properties of the tumor microenvironment, as our culture conditions were cytokine-rich. Cobimetinib induced very limited cell death in all AML samples, consistent with previous  reports  that  MEK  inhibitors  preferentially  suppress\n\nproliferation  and  promote  differentiation,  rather  than induce death. 33,37,38 Remarkably, over 60% of patients' samples  responded  to  the  combination  therapy,  notably including samples that were insensitive to both agents on their  own.  Moreover,  these  responders  carried  diverse genetic  alterations  that  affect  leukemia  cell  proliferation ( FLT3 , RAS ),  differentiation  ( RUNX1 ),  genomic  stability ( NPM1 ),  and  epigenetic  modifications  ( TET2 , IDH1 and IDH2 ).  Clonogenic assays demonstrated that the combination  markedly  impaired  the  colony-forming  functions\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nFigure 4. In vivo administration of cobimetinib in combination with venetoclax demonstrated anti-leukemia efficacy in acute myeloid leukemia xenograft mouse models. (A) NSGS mice were injected intravenously with OCI-AML3-Luci-GFP cells (1.0×10 ). Leukemia engraftment was confirmed 1 week later through a nonin6 vasive in vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) system following injection with a D-luciferin (4 mg\/mouse) substrate. Mice were dosed daily with oral vehicle or an orally active form of cobimetinib (Cobi; 10 mg\/kg) or venetoclax (Ven; 100 mg\/kg) or their combination (Combo) for 4 weeks. BLI data over time are shown. (B) Luciferase intensity [mean ± standard deviation(SD)] at week 5. Human CD45 engraftment in bone marrow and spleen was determined by time-of-flight mass spectrometry (C) BLI data over time from the leukemia model established with MOLM13-Luc-GFP cells (1×10 6 per animal) in NSGS mice. Mice received treatment as for the OCI-AML3\/Luc\/GFP model for 14 days.

P\n\nof AML progenitors, while normal progenitors were only minimally affected.\n\nCyTOF has proven to be a powerful approach for identifying  functional  proteins  in  diverse  cell  populations  at single-cell  levels. 39 Several  groups,  including  ours,  have studied  the  feasibility  of  CyTOF  in  AML. 26,40,41 In  this study,  we  utilized  CyTOF  combined  with  SPADE  software 42 to investigate the efficacy of cobimetinib and venetoclax  in  two  primary  patients'  samples:  one  responder and  one  non-responder.  BCL2  was  highly  expressed  in CD34 + stem\/progenitor cells compared to the CD34 -cells, underlying the critical need for BCL2 inhibition to eliminate  LSC.  The  venetoclax-sensitive  sample  displayed  a higher  level  of  BCL2  protein  than  the  resistant  sample. Cobimetinib inhibited G-CSF-induced pERK irrespective of response status. In line with several studies reporting that suppression of mTORC1 and its downstream pathways (specifically S6) predicted sensitivity to MEK inhibition, 21,22 our data also demonstrated that the pS6 signaling pathway was suppressed in the  cobimetinib-responding sample,  suggesting  that  S6  phosphorylation  may  be  a more predictive pharmacodynamic marker for MEK inhibition. However, the latter requires validation in a larger cohort of samples from patients.\n\nThe  distinct  response  patterns  in  AML  cell  lines  and patients' samples led us to search for additional pharmacodynamic  markers  correlating  with  drug  responses  using proteomic  and  transcriptomic  profiling.  In  line  with  the findings  of  an  extensive  study  of  MEK  inhibition, 20 we observed bypass induction of pMEK signaling upon MEK inhibition,  which  was  more  pronounced  in  cobimetinibresistant cell lines. Several signaling pathways were highly activated in cobimetinib-sensitive cell lines, including pS6, pERK,  p38MAPK,  and  pPTEN.  Lauchle  and  colleagues demonstrated  that  leukemia  clones  with  pre-existing resistance to MEK inhibition displayed reduced p38 kinase activity and increased RasGRP1 levels. 13 It was also previously reported that the RSK signaling pathway, which is downstream of MAPK, regulates an mTOR-independent pathway to induce S6 phosphorylation. 43 Western blotting analysis performed to validate the RPPA data showed that S6  phosphorylation  at  both  Ser235\/236  and  Ser240\/244 sites  was  markedly  suppressed  in  cobimetinib-sensitive OCI-AML3  and  MV4-11  cells.  In  OCI-AML3  cells,  the combination  treatment  resulted  in  significant  cell  death characterized  by  elevated  levels  of  cleaved  PARP ,  which could be attributed to disruption of BCL2:BIM complexes, releasing BIM to trigger apoptosis. We also observed BIM induction in MV4-11 cells, underscoring its critical role in the  efficacy  of  the  combination  of  BCL2  and  MEK inhibitors. 37,38,44 Although  RPPA  data  showed  no  modulation of MCL1 after cobimetinib treatment, both western blot and Meso Scale Discovery assays showed downregulation  of  MCL1  in  OCL-AML3 cells  and  upregulation  of MCL1 after venetoclax treatment. These data suggest that increased  MCL1  levels  induced  by  venetoclax  favor  the formation of MCL1:BIM complexes were disrupted, freeing BIM to initiate apoptosis. Consistent with these findings, we recently showed that MCL-1 degradation associated  with  MDM2  inhibition  occurs  through  MEK\/ERK suppression and GSK3 activation. 45 The downregulation of MYC  levels  by  cobimetinib  also  suggests  a  MEK\/ERKGSK3 β link,  as  ubiquitination  and  degradation  of  MYC requires phosphorylation at T58 by GSK3 β . 46 Furthermore, RNA sequencing analyses revealed enhanced expression of MYC and E2F target genes in cells demonstrating a synergistic response to the cobimetinib-venetoclax combination. This finding is consistent with a previous report that MEK inhibition  sensitized  cells  to  ABT-263-induced  apoptosis by promoting a G1 cell cycle arrest. 37 Glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) are known to be regulated by ERK signaling through RNK126-mediated ubiquitination  of  pyruvate  dehydrogenase  kinase. 30 Potent  antitumor efficacy has been demonstrated in melanoma cells through  combined  inhibition  of  BCL2,  OXPHOS  and MAPK signaling. 47 Alterations  in  p53  and  UPR  pathways identified by transcriptome analysis may also account for synergy between MEK and BCL2 inhibition. 48 These proposed  mechanisms  of  actions  are  summarized  in Online Supplementary  Figure  S10 .  However  these  models  require further validation in controlled mechanistic studies.\n\nThe potency of the cobimetinib and venetoclax combination  was  further  demonstrated in  vivo using  models established with OCI-AML3 (resistant to venetoclax) and MOLM13  (resistant  to  cobimetinib)  leukemia  cells. Although  we  observed  strong  synergistic  effects  in  both cell lines in vitro , the combination did not confer significant survival benefits in the in vivo models. This may be due to protection  against  cell  death  provided  by  the  microenvironment,  as  we  have  observed  in  patients'  samples  cultured in cytokine-rich medium. Similar to our in vitro observations, the OCI-AML3 xenograft model is hypersensitive to cobimetinib, and we found no significant survival differences between animals that received single-agent cobimetinib and those that received the combination. In the very aggressive MOLM13 model, in which untreated mice die 3 weeks after cell injection, the combination reduced but did not eliminate leukemia burden markedly on day 17.\n\nIn summary, combinatorial blockade of the MAPK and BCL2 pathways promotes cell death and suppresses proliferation in the majority of primary AML cells. This antileukemia  efficacy  is  associated  with  the  simultaneous inhibition of BCL2 by venetoclax and the downregulation of MCL1 mediated by cobimetinib, which together enable the release of the pro-death protein BIM. These preclinical data provided a strong mechanistic rationale for evaluating the combination of cobimetinib with venetoclax in a phase I trial now  enrolling elderly patients with relapsed\/refractory AML (NCT02670044), and initial data have included objective clinical responses. 49","label":[[7003,7015,"Gene"],[27149,27153,"Gene"],[27375,27379,"Gene"],[28623,28628,"Gene"],[30033,30037,"Gene"],[30445,30449,"Gene"]],"Comments":[]}
